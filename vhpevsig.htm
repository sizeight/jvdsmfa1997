<P><B>THE VIRTUAL HARVESTER' project</B><BR>

by Johann van der Schijff</P>

<P><B>Abstract</B></P>

<P><B>Introduction</B></P>

<P>THE VIRTUAL HARVESTER project is an effort to address the need for
global commitment and action to fight one of human society's most
basic problems - food insecurity. The United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) created the Poverty Clock to illustrate how quickly
poverty grows. Each successive digit on the clock indicates another
person living on less than $1 per day.</P>

<P>Synchronized to the Poverty Clock's ticking, one new plant sprouts
on the virtual corn field; yielding approximately 47 plants each
minute. Making use of the harbour simulator facility in Rotterdam,
the viewer will be surrounded by virtual corn plants, each
representing a person living in poverty. The Poverty Clock stands as
a stark reminder that deprivation and suffering continue.</P>

<P><B>YIELD - computer animation &amp; installation</B></P>

<P>Portraying a more oppressive vision of our digital world, I have
set out to project an environment wherein the technologies of freedom
&amp; information threaten to turn into machines of dominance &amp;
control. "While the tourist hovers past in his private helicopter /
we are down here / trying to figure out / what will be the weapon /
that we will one day wield." (an excerpt from a poem by Willem
Groenewegen)</P>

<P>The central objective of YIELD was to develop the iconography of
the overall project and to test the design credibility of the digital
models. Because both productions (YIELD &amp; DATA FIELD) make use of
the same 3D digital information, it creates the possibility for one
project to grow into the other.</P>

<P><B>DATA FIELD - harbour simulator</B></P>

<P>DATA FIELD was conceptualized to be experienced in one of the
harbour simulator facilities of <I>MarineSafety International</I>.
Instead of a ship's bridge, the platform will become a fictional,
harvester-cabin. In front of the viewers, virtually attached to the
pilothouse, will be an enormous virtual harvesting device. This
device will make a loud mechanical noise (amplified by the harbour
simulators 3D sound), vibrating the pilothouse from side to side
whilst reaping the harvest. As the yield is blown into virtual
storage trucks moving slowly alongside the pilothouse, viewers will
become aware of the scent of fresh grain rising above the noise &amp;
mechanical activity. The grain odour will rise from a thick layer of
yellow maize, covering the entire inside floor of the simulator.</P>

<P>The group standing, protected inside the pilothouse, will be able
to steer the virtual combine through green virtual maize fields,
leaving a trail of scorched earth behind the harvester's reaping
blades. Being able to control the movements of the harvester, the
group can choose between several corn fields ripe for reaping,
surrounding them in virtual space. Protruding from amongst the maize
fields are gigantic communication towers serving as beacons amidst
the vast virtual landscape. While the group 'plays the game,' it is
subtly revealed (via incoming messages on the harvester's two-way
radio system) that the virtual corn fields they are busy reaping are
in fact 3D visual data representation fields. The corn fields they
are surrounded by represent the number of people living in absolute
poverty across the globe...</P>

<P><B>Context</B></P>

<P>THE VIRTUAL HARVESTER project questions the motives of the Western
world's immersion in information technology, supposedly constructing
the global village. The work asks if the Western world is not
paradoxically isolating itself even further from the social and
economic realities of their impoverished neighbours. "Alongside the
ever-widening social divisions, another apartheid is being created
between the 'information-rich' and the and the
'information-poor.'"(an excerpt from <I>The Californian Ideology</I>
- Barbrook &amp; Cameron)</P>

<P>Robert Kaplan expands on this divide - both inside and outside
cyberspace - presently occurring. "Think of a stretch limo in the
potholed streets of New York City, where homeless beggars live.
Inside the limo are the air-conditioned post-industrial regions of
North America, Europe, the emerging Pacific Rim, and a few other
isolated places, with their trade summitry and computer-information
highways. Outside is the rest of mankind, going in a completely
different direction." (quote by Thomas F. Homer-Dixon from the book
<I>The Ends of the Earth</I>)</P>

<P>I believe that, for artists working in the electronic era, the
present crisis parallels that which was brought upon by the
industrial revolution. While the industrial revolution led to the
modern movement via cubism, and the industrialisation of Europe was
reflected in the anxieties of the modernist movement, so the
attendant anxieties which arise out of the post-industrial society
can be reflected upon through the concept of "cybernetics." The
purpose of my work is to evoke thoughts on how the information
structures of society control human behaviour and action.</P>

<P><B>Conclusion</B></P>

<P>As an artist (trained as a sculptor), I am not only reflecting on
the society in which I live, but I am also trying to expand the
possibilities new electronic technologies can open up for sculpture.
I want to explore how the combination of computer
animation/simulation with data influx from the world wide web can be
applied for art projects, specifically towards creating interactive
virtual environments.</P>

<P>Furthermore, I am interested in how projects like these can be
used to generate "media events," giving rise to popular awareness of
the use of the world wide web and it's capacity as an inexpensive
distribution network. This communication medium has enormous
potential to implement and affect development programs around the
world.</P>

<P>THE VIRTUAL HARVESTER is a project incorporating art &amp;
technology, striving to show how simple interaction by a few people
in one part of the globe can have a tremendous impact on the lives of
many people elsewhere. As such, the symbol of the "gieter"
(watering-can) is an apt metaphor signifying the importance of
interactive involvement. "Poverty places an intolerable burden on the
human spirit. We cannot accept that it will always be with us. The
modern world has the resources, the know-how and the expertise to
relegate poverty to the pages of history." (James Gustave Speth,
Administrator, UNDP International Day for the Eradication of Poverty,
17-10-1996)</P>
