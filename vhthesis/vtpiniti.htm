<P>Having started my studies in The Netherlands I immediately set out
to investigate and develop possible art projects. I wanted to come up
with projects that would combine the research and exploration of new
digital information technology with my iconography as developed
during my work and studies in South Africa. My approach as an artist,
influenced by the period I have worked as assistant to the South
African sculptor David Brown [Figure 4] in Cape Town, is that a
certain thread of thought should always be present in my work.
Working in different mediums could bring forth a lot of different
styles and methods, but the iconography informing them all should
remain constant. This approach taught by Brown, who in turn was
influenced by the work of the South African painter and graphic
artist Cecil Skotnes, stems from a long sculptural tradition as can
be seen in the work of o.a. Henry Moore, David Smith, and Constantin
Brancusi.</P>

<P>The initial research proposal I came up with as a subject for
research underlying my main project at MEDIA-GN was entitled <I>Is
there a link between Modern Sculpture and Mechatronics?</I> Below
I've included some of the most important ideas that arose from that
paper. <A NAME="06"></A><B><A HREF="vtpendno.htm#06">[6]</A></B></P>

<P>"If the threat of rising, even massive, structural unemployment,
i.e. the replacement of jobs for humans by robot and computer
controlled processes, the eradication and nullifying of jobs,
continue, I am afraid we shall soon see rapidly growing poverty and
misery in the Western world, probably unleashing an [sic] worldwide
economic crisis." (Weizenbaum 1983:9) [Figure 5]</P>

<P>As an artist my interest in 'mechatronics'
<A NAME="07"></A><B><A HREF="vtpendno.htm#07">[7]</A></B> -- the
synergetic combination of traditional engineering disciplines such as
mechanics, electronics and computer science whose implementation is
most obvious in the field of robotics -- is twofold. First, it is
practical, relating to the field of constructed metal and bronze
sculpture as well as dealing with cybernetics and artificial
intelligence, and second, it is theoretical and conceptual,
considering the issues that the use and implementation of these
'robots' expose.</P>

Mechatronics</FONT></TT></B></P>

<P>Through the method of collage the cubists incorporated products of
industrial mass production into their work. These processes in turn
had an influence on the development of modern sculpture, seen in
Picasso's use of tin in the production of constructions such as
<I>Guitar</I> of 1912. From that moment, sculpture was not conceived
of as a solid mass, but rather as an open construction of planes.
From the <I>Guitar</I>, via Russian constructivism, seen in the work
of Vladimir Tatlin, a tradition of assembled metal sculpture was
inaugurated in the West which culminated in the work of David Smith
and Anthony Caro.</P>

<P>For an artist like Smith the use of metal counted for more than
merely the radical new possibilities it opened up for sculpture: it
symbolised the industrial age to which he belonged. "My aim", he
wrote in 1952, "is the same as in locomotive building: to arrive at a
given functional form in the most efficient manner". (Van der
Schijff: 1996) [Figure 6]</P>

<P>For me as an artist, working in the area of computer graphics, one
growing concern and point of frustration is how to overcome the
limitations of interacting with a computer screen, working entirely
in the virtual world, and to move back into the organic, chaotic,
'real' physical world in which we find ourselves immersed most of the
time and whose tactile qualities are so important to me as a
sculptor.</P>

<P>Serendipity may have offered me an outcome to my dilemma. While
sourcing references in the library of the <I>Gasunie's</I>
<A NAME="08"></A><B><A HREF="vtpendno.htm#08">[8]</A></B> head office
in Groningen to describe the MIG -- Metal Inert Gas Welding Process,
a welding method I used extensively to construct sculptures, I came
upon the journal of the International Institute of Welding,
<I>Welding in the World</I>. With the theme "Advanced Techniques and
Low Cost Automation," 1994, Volume 34, it gave a survey of recent
advances and practical applications on mechatronics and robotics in
modern welding engineering.
<A NAME="09"></A><B><A HREF="vtpendno.htm#09">[9]</A></B> Although I
was aware of the use of robots in car production and shipbuilding, I
had never heard of 'mechatronics' or considered the application
thereof in artistic / sculptural terms. However, the more I read
about the introduction of advanced robotics and information
technology into modern welding fabrication, the more excited I became
about the possibilities it contained for making sculpture and
interactive installations. [Figure 7]</P>

<P>All along it seems that the indicators, of the path sculpture
could follow within the new paradigm of information technology, were
available within the welding techniques I used and applied everyday
in the studio for seven years, while practising as a sculptor. My
knowledge of welding, combined with the 3D computer animation
experience I have gained over the last two years, gives me the
confidence to seriously consider the field of mechatronics and
especially the application of robotics in modern welding, as a
subject for research underlying my main project at MDEIA-GN. The
final outcome of the project can take many forms; from an exhibit /
installation making use of actual welding robots, to better interface
design for the software used in running these robotic systems.</P>

<P>I eventually decided not to proceed with this project after
discussing my ideas with Prof. dr. ir. A.C.H. Van der Wolf,
Universitair Technologisch Instituut voor Integrale Produkt en
Produktie Vernieuwing / Mechatronica, Technische Universiteit
Eindhoven -- T.U.E. He advised me that the idea was probably to
complex for me to realize with the technical knowledge at my disposal
at that stage. It is my desire that sometime in the future a project
incorporating some of these ideas and technologies might still be
realized. However, the research done for Is there a link between
Modern Sculpture and Mechatronics ? planted a seed that would come to
sprout while experiencing the <I>Crossing Project</I>.</P>
