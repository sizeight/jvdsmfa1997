<P>In the introduction of this dissertation I stated "that I am not
only reflecting on the society in which I live, but am also trying to
extend the possibilities opened up for sculpture by new electronic
technologies. In the same way that cubism, via industrial society,
altered the course of sculpture, I suggested that cybernetics /
cyberpunk, via the electronic / information society, is leading to a
new direction in sculpture."</P>

<P>During my studies at MEDIA-GN, I have explored how the combination
of computer animation / simulation with data influx from the world
wide web can be applied to art projects, specifically towards
creating interactive virtual environments. After this exploration, my
current view regarding sculpture can best be summed up by an answer
given by Greg Lynn in an interview at "The Roelof Kiers Masterclass"
<A NAME="38"></A><B><A HREF="vtpendno.htm#38">[38]</A></B>. When
asked how he sees media changing architecture, Lynn, an architectural
theorist, designer and professor at Columbia University, responded:
"Architecture often thinks of itself as a very material discipline.
While in fact, most of what we do is transmitted in a mediaform like
drawings and computerfiles. Media makes architecture seen [sic] less
about matter and a little more about information." (1997)</P>

<P>Initially media effects design (and thus sculpture) in a twofold
way by generative design and community design. Firstly, the growing
availability of cheap and powerful computational power, offers a
range of new design techniques. Using computers as a generative tool,
the possibility of involving large quantities of variables allow to
derive more complex spatial configurations. (Hensel 1997) The future
of sculpture seems to lie in the 'breeding' and evolving of form, the
work of Karl Sims serving as an example. In <I>Yield</I> this is
generated by the multiplied versions of the cornplant. Starting with
a single digital modelled maize plant, I could quickly create a
cornfield.</P>

<P>Secondly, advanced telecommunications and networking enable the
immediate integration of several groups of participants into the
design process via direct access to the project's dataset. Through
continual available access in the development of projects, clients
and specialist consultants can partake in the design process
simultaneously. (Hensel 1997) This highly flexible system was applied
in the production of the maize plant and combiner 3D models for
<I>Yield</I>. All mediation taking place via email, these computer
models were specialy constructed for the project in Madrid
<A NAME="39"></A><B><A HREF="vtpendno.htm#39">[39]</A></B>, and also
delivered via email once completed.</P>

<P>Furthermore, I am interested in how projects like the <I>Virtual
Harvester</I> can be used to generate "media events," giving rise to
popular awareness of the use of the world wide web and its capacity
as an inexpensive distribution network. This communication medium has
enormous potential to implement and affect development programs
around the world. One such project is the comic strip series <I>Benza
and Betty</I>, drawn by my friend Jacques Coetzer for the Agriculture
Research Council (ARC) in South Africa. The project aims to
facilitate practical agriculture-related information to developing
communities in sub-Saharan Africa.
<A NAME="40"></A><B><A HREF="vtpendno.htm#40">[40]</A></B> <I>Green
Dish</I> – an ongoing undertaking, is a network of people involved in
the implementation of digital media and information technology in the
developing world.</P>

<P>The <I>Virtual Harvester</I> is a project incorporating art and
technology, striving to show how simple interaction by a few people
in one part of the globe can have a tremendous impact on the lives of
many people elsewhere. As such, the symbol of the "gieter"
(watering-can) is an apt metaphor signifying the importance of
interactive involvement. "Poverty places an intolerable burden on the
human spirit. We cannot accept that it will always be with us. The
modern world has the resources, the know-how and the expertise to
relegate poverty to the pages of history." (James Gustave Speth,
Administrator, UNDP International Day for the Eradication of Poverty,
17-10-1996)</P>
