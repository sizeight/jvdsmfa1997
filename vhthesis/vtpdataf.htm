<P><I>Data Field</I> is based on the original proposal for <I>The
Reality of Virtual Reality Project -- ISEA 96</I>. During this
symposium the large harbour simulator of <I>MarineSafety</I>
Rotterdam [Figure 23] was made available for artistic projects. The
simulator consists of 360&#176; visual, 3D sound and a moving
platform (the pilothouse) with two degrees of freedom. The computer
system consists of 22 SGI Crimsons and a DEC Vax. <I>MarineSafety
International</I>
<A NAME="19"></A><B><A HREF="vtpendno.htm#19">[19]</A></B> is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of <I>FlightSafety International</I>,
providing simulator training for Marine pilots and Naval officers.
Other MSI centres are located in Kings Point, NY; Newport, RI; San
Diego, CA and Valejo,CA. ( MarineSafety 1997)</P>

<P><I>Data Field</I> was conceptualized to be experienced in one of
the harbour simulator facilities of <I>MarineSafety
International</I>. Instead of a ship’s bridge, the platform will
become a fictional harvester-cabin (wherein groups of 10 -- 15 people
can stand). In front of the viewers, virtually attached to the
pilothouse, will be an enormous virtual harvesting device. This
device will make a loud mechanical noise (amplified by the harbour
simulators 3D sound), vibrating the pilothouse from side to side
whilst reaping the harvest. At "7 o'clock" in relation to the front
of the pilothouse vision, there will be a virtual pipe protruding
into space from which the virtual grains are blown into virtual
storage trucks moving slowly alongside the pilothouse. Rising above
the noise and mechanical activity, the viewers will become aware of
the scent of fresh grain. The grain odour will rise from a thick
layer of yellow maize, covering the entire inside floor area of the
simulator.</P>

<P>The group standing, protected inside the pilothouse, will be able
to steer the virtual combine through green virtual maize fields,
[Figure 24] leaving a trail of scorched earth behind the harvester's
reaping blades. Being able to control the movements of the harvester,
the group can choose between several corn fields ripe for reaping,
surrounding them in virtual space. Protruding from amongst the maize
fields are gigantic communication towers serving as beacons amidst
the vast virtual landscape. While the group 'plays the game,' it is
subtly revealed (via incoming messages on the harvester's two-way
radio system) that the virtual corn fields they are busy reaping are
in fact 3D visual data representation fields. The corn fields they
are surrounded by represent the number of people living in absolute
poverty across the globe...</P>

<P>Hence, each corn plant in the corn field represents one person
living in poverty. The number of people living in poverty, and thus
the number of corn plants, is based on the statistics of the United
Nations "Poverty Clock".</P>

<P>As the viewers leave the pilothouse, each person will receive a
plastic chip card, as a reminder of their virtual experience within
the data field (of poverty). The chip on this card will contain
information about the amount of corn they, as a group, have harvested
in their session and the number of plants that still remains
unharvested. Such a card can give access to the <I>Virtual
Harvester's</I> central data base. This data base can be accessed by
way of the global automatic banking network. In this way, a current
statement on the virtual corn field’s growth can be given 24 hours a
day.</P>

<P>Apart from referring to virtual reality and cyberspace (as
described in the previous section), <I>Data Field</I> incorporates
four other related aspects of today’s information age in its
application as an installation. They are feedback and cybernetics,
networks, simulation and hyperreality.</P>

Cybernetics</FONT></TT></B></P>

<P>Ktesisbios who lived in Alexandria in the first half of the third
century B.C. is credited today for inventing the first 'true'
automatic device. Ktesisbios's clock
<A NAME="20"></A><B><A HREF="vtpendno.htm#20">[20]</A></B> kept
extremely good time by self-regulating its water supply. The
regulating valve that he invented to compromize the water flow was a
predecessor to the floating ball in the upper chamber of today's
flush toilet. After a flush, the floating ball goes down with the
declining water level, pulling open the water supply valve. The
incoming water fills the chamber again, raising the ball so that its
arm closes the flow of water at the precise level assigned to it. As
such the working of a flush toilet is a perfect example to describe
the principle of a feedback loop.</P>

<P>The flyball regulator
<A NAME="21"></A><B><A HREF="vtpendno.htm#21">[21]</A></B> installed
onto steam engines regulating the engine to run at any rate was a
revolutionary feedback mechanism that had a profound influence on the
industrial revolution. The steam engines that ran the mills of the
industrial age would have been unworkable creations (exploding by
their own force) if it wasn't for the parallel information
revolution, launched by the automatic feedback system that the
flyball regulator enforced. "So information, and not coal itself,
turned the power of machines useful and therefore more desirable."
(Kelly 1995:115) Thus the feedback mechanisms inherent in the
workings of steam engines of the industrial revolution pointed the
way towards the information age of our present post-industrial
society.</P>

<P>Norbert Wiener, wrote: "Feedback is a method of controlling a
system by reinserting into it the results of its past
performance."(Kelly 1995: 439) Wiener, an American mathematician,
coined the word 'cybernetics' in 1947 to describe the idea of
feedback and servomechanics. As the title of his book implies,
<I>Cybernetics: or control and communication in the animal and the
machine</I>, for Wiener cybernetics comprised all systems,
mechanical, electronic and biological, in which the flow of
information played a role. Wiener used 'cybernetic' to describe the
concept of machines that can handle information, make decisions, and
control the operation of other machines. Because the concept of
information plays such a central role, cybernetics is also known as
'information theory' or 'communication theory'. As such the science
of cybernetics was the forerunner of modern computer science.

<P>The aim of cybernetic analysis is to define and isolate which
particular piece of information passing between parts of a system
motivates which action, or alters which states in the communicants.
In its most basic form, the cybernetic system is made up of a
receptor obtaining information as input from the outside. This
information is processed and sent to an effector or sender which then
responds to the initial information with output. The output, however,
alters the original conditions on the outside, thus leading to new
information being sent in the form of input back into the system,
establishing what is called a 'feedback loop'. [Figure 25]</P>

<P>By extension, cybernetics can be applied to the study of any
communication system. These include information processing mechanisms
such as computers, self-governing machines and automata, and
communication systems inherent within the human body such as the
relationship between brain and behaviour. Because of these
applications, cybernetics is an appropriate metaphor for
conceptualising society: the notion that the brain functions like a
computer, that a person is like a machine, that society is like a
feedback mechanism, allows for an investigation into the ways in
which information functions in a post-industrial age.</P>

<P>In <I>An Electronic Laager</I> I reflected on the ways the
<I>National Party</I> had used information for indoctrination
purposes in apartheid era South Africa. I expanded the theme so as to
question the freedom of individuals in the configuration of the mass
media and state apparatuses that form the "neocapitalist cybernetic
order."(Baudrillard 1983: 111)

<P>The aim of the <I>Virtual Harvester</I> project is to simulate the
growth of poverty in the world today, synchronized to input from the
UNDP's Poverty Clock. Immersed into 'data fields of poverty' the
group of participants seem to have no alternative but to harvest more
poverty, or alternatively to stop the machine. As such the project
reflects on the disparity between the rich and the poor which is
growing wider in today’s global village, with no obvious solution at
hand. A feedback loop is thus in place that can lead to only one
result -- anarchy.</P>

Kevin Kelly wrote in <I>Out of Control</I>: "The symbol of science
for the next century is the dynamical Net." (Kelly 1994: 25) The Net
is an archetype to represent circuits, interdependence, large
economics, social and ecological systems. There is hardly a single
aspect in the world of business that has not been influenced either
directly or indirectly by the introduction of "network logic".

27] Networks allows companies to manufacture new kinds of products,
in faster and more flexible ways, in greater response to customers
needs, in much shorter time. Laws and the economy have changed due to
global 24-hour networking of financial institutions. Instant cash
from ATM machines, credit cards, international travel, fax machines,
email, internet, etc. are all heavily reliant on networks.</P>

<P>Some of the characteristics to describe networks are distributed
(no single location), decentralized (no central control),
collaborative (mutual benefit), adaptive (work in realtime -- bar
codes, laser scanners, cellular phones), flexibility (smaller numbers
of items in smaller time periods), mass customization
(individuality), global accounting (economic frontiers disappear) and
increasing returns (them that has, gets more).</P>

<P>The first example of a distributed network implemented by humans
was the Nazi Blitzkrieg: a network of weapon systems integrated
together through the use of radio communications. As such it showed
the way to the future in warfare, where the emphasis switched from
machines with components in physical contact with each other to
machines with components operating over vast geographical distances.
(De Landa 1991: 150 and158) Influenced by this historical information
the machines appearing in the <I>Virtual Harvester</I>, painted in
the green and yellow livery of the state or 'organisation', are
portrayed as being in constant communication with each other.</P>

<P>"SimCity
<A NAME="26"></A><B><A HREF="vtpendno.htm#26">[26]</A></B> is an
urban theory provided with a users interface. In the same sense, a
dollhouse is a theory of the household. A novel is a theory told as
story. A flight simulator is an interactive theory of aviation."
Kelly goes on to say "a theory abstracts the complicated pattern of
real things into the facsimile pattern -- a model, or a
simulation...If done well, the miniature captures some integrity of
the larger hole." (Kelly 1994: 236)</P>

<P>The modern era of computer simulated war games began in the 1950s
at the RAND Corporation. Today on an everyday basis at a dozen U.S.
army bases around the world, tank and aircraft pilots compete with
each other in simulated AirLand battles connected to each other by a
military system called SIMNET. As Douglas Nelms, National Defence
columnist explains, SIMNET "transports crews of land and aerial
vehicles from planet Earth to a surrogate world where they can do
battle without the constraints of safety, cost, environmental impact
or geographical boundaries." (Kelly 1994: 244) One tank can attack
another tank within the virtual land of SIMNET, even though some of
the crew may be in a simulator in California while others could be in
a simulator in Germany. Long-haul telephone lines link the other 300
existing simulator boxes worldwide into one network, enabling them
all to move through the same virtual battleground.</P>

<P>What the US military is working towards is simulated training so
'real' that it becomes indistinguishable from actual combat. Already
a real human tank gunner operator’s only portal to the outside
battlefield is through a tiny TV display in front of his face; his
link to the rest of his crew is through a headset. For all practical
purposes a real gunner in a real tank operates a simulation. This
slipperiness between real life and virtual life can be described by
the term hyperreality.</P>

<P>The Italian novelist Umberto Eco, driving around America in the
early 1970's, found it a country bustling in messages about
simulation and degrees of reality. The national icon, Coca-Cola
advertised itself as "the real thing." Eco wrote that he was on a
"journey into hyperreality, in search of instances where the American
imagination demands the real thing and, to attain it, must fabricate
the absolute fake.”(Kelly 1995:238) Hyperreality thus emerges where
"absolute unreality is offered as real presence."(1995:238).</P>

<P>In his book <I>Simulations</I> (1983) the French philosopher Jean
Baudrillard states: "Abstraction today is no longer that of the map,
the double, the mirror or the concept. Simulation is no longer that
of a territory, a reverential being, or a substance. It is the
generation of models of a real without origin or reality: a
hyperreal."(1995:239) A very good computer simulation, like the one I
would like to create in the large harbour simulator of Rotterdam, is
thus a perfect example of hyperreality.</P>

<P>A more bizarre example of hyper-reality was the coverage of the
Gulf War by <I>CNN</I>. [Figure 28] Television audiences across the
world seemed to have had a similar view of the battle as the
participants. Commenting on the war Baudrillard stated: "Our
strategic site is the television screen, from which we are
bombarded". He argued that there was no "thing itself","no real war
depicted in the images", but only a simulation of it. (Woolley 1993:
196)</P>

installation during the <I>DEAF 96: Digital Territories</I>
symposium. He took me on an tour through the <I>MarineSafety</I>
facility, showing me also the smaller simulator environments
available at the facility. He then explained to me that the spatial
orientation and principles of the software used by the harbour
facility are based on the Cartesian coordinate system, similar to the
software I used to produce <I>Yield</I>. [Figure 29] This implies
that the learning curve to familiarize oneself with the 3D software
used in the harbour simulator should be short.</P>
