<P>By experiencing and observing the State's control of South African
information structures during the apartheid era, I became aware of
the way information structures in society influence people's actions
and perceptions. On a global scale, advances in information
technology are changing the way society functions; from the way
people conduct their work and play to the way they make war.
Consequently, it was notions of communication, or cybernetics,
comprising all systems in which information plays a role, which
evolved as a central theme for my Masters Degree in Fine Art,
University of Cape Town, June 1994.</P>

<P>In that study, entitled <I>An Electronic Laager: A sculptural
interpretation of post-industrial society's cybernetic order</I>
<A NAME="01"></A><B><A HREF="vtpendno.htm">[1]</A></B>, I analyzed
the relevance of cybernetics as a metaphor of control. I argued that
information structures underline the contemporary paradigm of
post-industrial society
<A NAME="02"></A><B><A HREF="vtpendno.htm#02">[2]</A></B>, and that
the concept of cybernetics can reflect on this development. I
analyzed the electronic media and the way artists have responded to
the new electronic era. I explored the ways in which science fiction
predictions have become the realities addressed by the genre of
cyberpunk. Finally, I showed how the above issues combined in my
sculptural work to become a reflection of the time and space in which
I had found myself as an artist.</P>

<P>I have constructed an analogy between intelligent machines
programmed to perform in a certain way, and society programmed to
function accordingly, as a response to the influence of modern
electronic communication networks. The aesthetics derived from this
intercultural exchange were reflected in the body of constructed
metal sculptures. [Figure 1] Cyberpunk literature, music, and film
have all influenced my iconography and have helped me to create a
metaphorical description of the South-African situation within the
post-industrial paradigm. Linking these cyberpunk influences with the
genres of colonialism and a post-apocalyptic landscape , such as
those found in the writings J. M. Coetzee's <I>Waiting for the
Barbarians</I> (1980)
<A NAME="03"></A><B><A HREF="vtpendno.htm#03">[3]</A></B> , I have
set out to portray an environment in which machines and implements
are involved in an imaginary struggle. These concerns are reflected
in the work of a number of South African artists, such as William
Kentridge, Gavin Younge , [Figure 2] Jo Ractliffe and David Brown.

<P>The subtext underlying the machines and implements in my work was
a communication network linking all the sculptures. This conceptual
communication web, or cyberspace<B>
<A NAME="04"></A><A HREF="vtpendno.htm#04">[4]</A></B>, was the
foundation upon which the body of work rested, in-so-far as it
attempted to portray a cybernetic system in action. A moving radar
scanner, transmitting TV monitors, micro-electronic components and
radio antennas were used to create the illusion of the existence of
such a communication network. The group of sculptures was intended to
provide a field of receptors and communicators which promote, or
provoke, interaction from the viewer. These imaginary feedback loops
questioned personal autonomy in the face of an outside technocratic
world order. [Figure 3]</P>

<P>Formally, cybernetics dealt with a fundamental sculptural aspect:
space in and around objects. In the same way that cyberpunk writers
have created cyberspace to provide a narrative compensation 'tool' to
describe the loss of visibility and space in today's technological /
cybernetic world, contemporary sculptors face the challenge of
addressing this phenomenon. Where Rodin's and Moore's work dealt with
the interaction of space and form, new electronic technologies and
their related concepts extend the possibilities of objects in space,
to time, to movement and to entirely new virtual environments!</P>

<P>I concluded my studies in Cape Town stating: "that I am not only
reflecting on the society in which I live, but am also trying to
extend the possibilities opened up for sculpture by new electronic
technologies. In the same way that cubism, via industrial society,
altered the course of sculpture, I would suggest that cybernetics /
cyberpunk, via the electronic / information society, is leading to a
new direction in sculpture."</P>

<P><B><TT><FONT SIZE="+1">1.2. Motivation</FONT></TT></B></P>

<P>This conclusion was the driving force that lead me to become
involved in the field of computer graphics. I finished a multimedia
course that explored ways of developing interactive CD-ROMs and
worked briefly for a multimedia company. Thereafter I was involved
with a computer animated, 3D stereoscopic production for <I>The
Coca-Cola Company</I>, which was used as campaign / entertainment
during the World Cup Rugby Tournament during the first part of 1995
in South Africa. Inside an inflatable rubber dome surround videos
were projected, combining edited footage of Coca-Cola advertisements
with original 3D stereoscopic computer animations created by
<I>Haptics</I> (production company in Johannesburg I worked for)
<A NAME="05"></A><B><A HREF="vtpendno.htm#05">[5]</A></B>. This was
the first time a 3D stereoscopic production was shown in South Africa
in such an environment and on such a scale.</P>

<P>These brief experiences within the commercial multimedia field
convinced me as an artist that computer graphics, specifically the
area of 3D animation and simulation combined with interactivity,
leading towards virtual environments, is the area in which a new
realisation of sculpture could be achieved. Motivated by this belief,
combined with an enthusiasm to develop and broaden my skills and a
desire for international exposure, I approached the Postgraduate
Programme in New Media, MEDIA-GN, Groningen, The Netherlands. "The
aim of this programme is the study of new digital media from an art
and design perspective, by studying new digital information
technology and its social and cultural context and researching and
executing art and design projects." -- Mr. Jules van de Vijver,
Director, MEDIA-GN.</P>
