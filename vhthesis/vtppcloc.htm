<P>The idea of simulating the growth of virtual cornfields being
planted while experiencing the <I>Crossings Project</I>, I started to
develop the concept further. Looking for a source of data to 'feed'
the growth of the virtual cornplants, I came upon the <I>Eradicating
Poverty</I> website
<A NAME="13"></A><B><A HREF="vtpendno.htm#13">[13]</A></B> of The
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). On that website I found
the "Poverty Clock." [Figure 12] The UNDP created the Poverty Clock
to illustrate how quickly poverty grows. Each successive digit on the
clock indicates another person living on less than $1.00 (U.S.) per
day.</P>

<P>The number of people living in absolute poverty is increasing by
nearly 25 million a year. This calculation is based on the World Bank
and the United Nations definition of absolute poverty: those people
whose incomes are no more than $370 a year, or approximately $1.00
(U.S.) per day. The number of people currently living in absolute
poverty is roughly 1.3 billion.</P>

<P>Recent data from the World Bank and the Human Development Report
suggest that the aggregate number of poor people worldwide is
increasing at roughly the same rate as the annual population growth
of the developing world, or about 1.88 per cent. Based on these
statistics, the Poverty Clock is ticking off the number of new people
living in poverty at approximately 47 per minute.</P>

<P>According to the UNDP the "calculation is based on extensive
consultations with population statisticians at the UN Population
Trends Unit, and the World Bank Statistics Office. Other sources were
a study, 'Rooting Out Poverty,' by <I>Actionaid</I>, and a paper, 'Is
Poverty Increasing in the Developing World?' by Martin Ravallion,
Shaohua Chen and Gaurav Datt of the World Bank."

<P>James Gustave Speth, Administrator of the UNDP, officially
activated the clock on January 17 1996, at 18:30 GMT
<A NAME="15"></A><B><A HREF="vtpendno.htm#15">[15]</A></B>. The idea
of the clock formed part of the commemoration of 1996 as the
International Year for the Eradication of Poverty. [Figure 13 - 15]
"The world has the material and natural resources, the know-how and
the people to make a poverty-free world a reality," Mr. Speth said.
"One hundred and sixty years ago, the world launched a world crusade
against slavery. Today I call upon you to launch a similar crusade
for a world without poverty."</P>
