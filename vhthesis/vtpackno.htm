<P>I would like to thank my parents, without their love and support
my studies abroad could not have been embarked upon. My dad, Manie
van der Schijff, to whose memory I dedicate this project, has always
been my biggest inspiration and example to follow.</P>

<P>I acknowledge the guidance of my supervisor Mr. Jules van de
Vijver, and thank him for his advice and insight. His inspiration in
the field of digital media and art has changed the course of my
career.</P>

<P>Thanks also goes to Eric Kluitenberg, Paul Perry and David Garcia,
all of whom acted as supervisors to this project.</P>

<P>Thanks to my fellow students, Yvonne le Grand, Ad de Bont, Arno
Coenen, Edo Schoonbeek, Erik Schoppen, and Ren&eacute; Bosma, for

the staff at MEDIA-GN, especially George Herfkens, Babs Warner,
Arthur Elsenaar, Martin Bartels and Daan Tweehuysen, who made my work
in Groningen such an enjoyable experience.</P>

Groenewegen, Jeroen Hoekstra, Paul Gr&auml;ffner and Jannie van der
