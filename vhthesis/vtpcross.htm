<P>The <I>Crossing Project</I> was a virtual environment created by
Stacey Spiegel in collaboration with Rodney Hoinkes, presented at the
Rotterdam harbour simulator, as part of <I>DEAF 95</I> -- 'The Dutch
Electronic Art Festival'. The idea behind the <I>Crossing Project</I>
was that virtual agents collect data on a particular subject on the
world wide web. This information was then used as data to 'grow' or
'build' a virtual environment.</P>

<P>What immediately appealed to me about this concept, was that one
could apply any data as a source for virtual growth. The social
issues that the implementation of information technology implied --
touched upon in my initial research -- could be visualized in
dramatic and spectacular fashion. The harbour simulator, situated in
Rotterdam (arguably the biggest export harbour of the world) and
utilizing some of the most advanced computer simulation technology,
became a very powerful symbol for me of the Western world’s adventure
into the world of cyberspace and its position towards the rest of the
world -- 'left behind in reality'. At a time of unequalled wealth
disparity, never made visible so clearly because of the global
communications revolution, the challenge was how to make a powerful
artistic statement using this facility. The <I>Crossing Project</I>
provided some answers...</P>

<P>"<I>Crossings</I> is focused on the discourse surrounding the
mechanization of nature. Its environment is the signature of our
post-industrial era and reasserts that both reality and virtuality
are constructs that extend beyond the geographical terrain into the
conceptual realm." (Spiegel 1997)

<P>As an alternative method to navigate the information space of
cyberspace, Spiegel and Hoinkes' "basic assumption is that, by
translating experience from the real world, virtual landscapes become
primary opportunities to explore cultural identity and play with the
nature of information." Spiegel explains that reconstructing a
simulated 3-dimensional landscape, this "metaphor for real space --
dimensionally accurate, though abstracted in representation --
extends the surreal potential meaning through landscape." Spiegel and
Hoinkes are playing at the boundary of representation. Although their
discourse takes place in cyberspace it is their belief that all the
environments they create are visual analogues of the 'real'
3-dimensional world we live in. (Spiegel 1997) [Figure 9]</P>

<P>"As one roams around, the symbolic layers of the environment
unfold into psychological, emotional and intellectual spaces. Like
Alice passing through the looking-glass, each form one encounters in
the landscape has the potential to link the participant to other
realities." (Spiegel 1997)</P>

<P>In practice the idea was that hypermedia links allow the viewer to
access sound, text and images as well as animations and video
available on the world wide web. Having experienced the installation
myself, this aspect of the installation did not seem to be
implemented at the time.</P>

<P>However, what did excite me very much about this installation was
the element of "playing at the boundary of representation." As viewer
one was standing on a moving platform (the pilothouse) that could be
'navigated' through the 360&#176; surround computer generated
landscape created by Spiegel and Hoinkes. Experiencing this with a
group of other people that reacted to situations unfolding and sounds
coming from the virtual landscape contributed very much to the
overall sensation.</P>

<P>The absence of bulky and inconvenient VR headgear, allowing for
only a solo experience into virtual reality, appealed very much to
me. The pace of the movements (being a ship simulator) were also very
smooth and almost dreamlike, thereby enhancing the surreal feeling.
Unlike any virtual reality worlds experienced in game arcades and
Disneyworld attractions before, this 'show' really felt like a
journey into someone else's imagination, but then accompanied by a
group of people -- talking, laughing and discussing our shared
experience.</P>

<P>Two primary software packages, <I>PolyTRIM</I> [Figure 10], a
real-time design inquiry program, and <I>CLRMosaic</I> [Figure 11], a
simplified version of <I>Polytrim</I> that is integrated with the
<I>Mosaic</I> web browser were used by Spiegel and Hoinkes. Models
and environments have been developed in <I>PolyTRIM</I>,
<I>AutoCAD</I> and other modellers (incorporated through DXF file
format), automated algorithms, and C-library additions. Filters also
exist from many GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and CAD (DXF,
SGO, and Architrion) systems or can be generated directly into SDML
format.</P>

<P>"PolyTRIM is a research toolkit for the exploration of design and
planning issues at both a pedagogical and professional level. It is
premised around the ideas of interaction with design ideas and
constructs to allow investigation at an intuitive speed, and the
facilitation of more democratic design processes through
participatory workshop strategies." (PolyTRIM 1997)

<P>"CLRMosaic is a World-Wide Web client, allowing the handling of
spatial databases along with traditional hypertext data sources. This
provides a mechanism for people to provide hooks to resources that
are fundamentally spatially organized, geographic mapping, 3d
reconstructions, architectural proposals, cyberspaces, etc. This
client is premised around the notion of interactive exploration of
environments and easy access to information through it." ( CLRMosaic
