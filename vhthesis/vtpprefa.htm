<P><I>The Virtual Harvester</I> project is an effort to address the
need for global commitment and action to fight one of human society's
most basic problems -- food insecurity. The United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) created the Poverty Clock to illustrate
how quickly poverty grows. Each successive digit on the clock
indicates another person living on less than $1.00 (U.S.) per day.
Synchronized to the Poverty Clock's ticking, one new plant sprouts on
the virtual corn field; yielding approximately 47 plants each minute.

<P><I>The Virtual Harvester</I> was conceptualized to be experienced
in the harbour simulator facility in Rotterdam. Instead of a ship's
bridge, the platform displays a fictional harvester-cabin. In front
of the viewers, virtually attached to the pilothouse, is an enormous
virtual harvesting device. The device produces a loud mechanical
noise (amplified by the harbour simulator's 3D sound), vibrating the
pilothouse from side to side while it reaps the harvest. As the yield
is blown into virtual storage trucks moving slowly alongside the
pilothouse, viewers will become aware of the scent of fresh grain
rising from a thick layer of yellow maize that covers the entire
inside floor of the simulator.</P>

<P>As they stand protected inside the pilothouse, viewers will be
able to steer the virtual combine through green virtual cornfields,
leaving a trail of scorched earth behind the harvester's reaping
blades. Protruding from the fields are gigantic communication towers
serving as beacons amidst the vast virtual landscape. While the
viewers 'play the game,' it is subtly revealed (via incoming messages
on the harvester's two-way radio system) that the virtual cornfields
are in fact 3D visual data fields that represent the number of people
living in absolute poverty across the globe.</P>

<P><I>The Virtual Harvester</I> questions the motives of the Western
world’s immersion in information technology as it constructs "the
global village." The work asks if the Western world is not,
paradoxically, isolating itself even further from the social and
economic realities of their impoverished neighbours.</P>

<P>"Alongside the ever-widening social divisions, another apartheid
is being created between the 'information-rich' and the
'information-poor.'" (an excerpt from <I>The Californian Ideology</I>
-- Barbrook and Cameron)</P>
