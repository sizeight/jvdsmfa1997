<P>The central objective of <I>Yield</I> (computer animation and
installation) [Figure 16] was to develop the iconography of <I>The
Virtual Harvester</I> project and to test the design credibility of
the digital models. Because both productions, <I>Yield </I>and
<I>Data Field</I> (to be described later), make use of the same 3D
digital information, it creates the possibility for one project to
grow into the other. Portraying a more oppressive vision of our
digital world, I have set out to project an environment wherein the
technologies of freedom and information threaten to turn into
machines of dominance and control. "While the tourist hovers past in
his private helicopter / we are down here / trying to figure out /
what will be the weapon / that we will one day wield."  (Groenewegen

<P>The iconography of <I>Yield</I>, developing from the research done
for <I>An Electronic Laager</I> (as described earlier), was
influenced by the writings of the cyberpunk movement in '80s science
fiction (SF). Although cyberpunk is the product of the 1980's milieu,
it is rooted in the tradition of popular SF literature, especially
those with a more dystopian message. Of special importance are the
'60s and '70s New Wave writers such as Samuel R. Delany, Philip K.
Dick, and J. G. Ballard, as well as the postmodern fragmentations of
William Burroughs and apocalypticism of Thomas Pynchon.</P>

<P>Also influential were the "postmodern" movies of the last decade
(<I>TRON</I>, <I>Blade Runner</I>, the <I>Mad Max</I> films, [Figure
17] <I>Brazil</I>, <I>Robocop</I>, [Figure 18] <I>Terminator 2</I>,
<I>The Lawnmower Man</I> etc.), portraying material conditions at the
end of the century in a catastrophic state of decline. Other noted
influences are musicians and punk bands (Laurie Anderson, Lou Reed
and the Velvet Underground, Sonic Youth, The Sex Pistols, Pink Floyd,
The Clash, U2), and performance and installation artists (Nam June
Paik, Demers and Vorn, Stelarc, Mark Pauline and the Survival
Research Laboratories). Unlike the <I>Star Wars</I> and <I>Indiana
Jones</I> movies, with their romantic reaffirmation of the righteous
empire and neo-colonial adventurism, the spaces described in
cyberpunk fiction were not the expansive realms of far-away empires
or enormous spaceships. Cyberpunk rather described a street level
science fiction that foregrounded a perverse urbanism, marked by its
visual intensity.
<A NAME="17"></A><B><A HREF="vtpendno.htm#17">[17]</A></B></P>

<P>This highly-stylized narrative form can be read as a reflection of
the information overload that characterizes today's urban societies,
and McLuhan's metaphor of the implosion of the media. (Expansive SF
was based on historical analogies of colonialism and exploration.)
The implosive SF of cyberpunk is based on analogies of the invasion
and transformation of the body (prosthetic limbs, cosmetic surgery)
and mind (brain-computer interfaces, neuro-chemistry) by the 'alien'
technologies of our own making. It draws from the history of the
development of robotics and computers as Manuel De Landa describes:
"In this chart the robot would see the evolution of armies as
machines (clockworks, motors and networks), the different forms in
which intelligence 'migrated' from human bodies to become incarnated
in physical contraptions, and the processes through which artificial
forms of perception (vision, hearing) came to be synthesized and
embodied in computers." (1991: 10)</P>

<P>Cyberpunk unveils how these technologies are redefining the nature
of humanity and the nature of self as the distinction between organic
and non-organic life is becoming blurred. From these writers point of
view humans have served only as "machines' surrogate reproductive
organs until robots acquired their own self-replication
capabilities." (1991: 7) The cyberpunk artists' vision is that the
technological dreams and nightmares spoken of in SF literature are
already part of reality. A collapse of the future on the present has
occurred with the advent of post-industrialism.</P>

<P>In his provocative book (which I will refer to extensively during
this study) <I>The Ends of the Earth: A journey to the frontiers of
Anarchy</I> reporter Robert Kaplan relates a story he was told by a
foreign ambassador while he dined with him in Abidjan. I am referring
to this account because it sounds like a description from a modern
cyberpunk novel and hence it relates very well to the helicopter
sequence in <I>Yield</I>. [Figure 19] In these scenes a helicopter
transports the viewers across a virtual wasteland towards lush 'data
fields of poverty'.</P>

<P>The ambassador told about a visit he had made to the extreme
northwest of the Ivory Coast to observe an international aid project
supported by the United Nations, implemented to eradicate river
blindness. Black flies accumulating over and alongside the rivers of
interior Africa causes the disease when they sting African people as
they bathe and wash their clothes in the rivers.</P>

<P>It was a difficult and dangerous operation. The helicopters doing
the spraying had to deal with flying upwind at high speeds, near the
water, over and in between small side streams not much higher than
their rotor blades, with trees on either side. Landsat satellites
beamed down computerized pictures showing the state of each river and
side stream. Highly sensitive computers monitored the chemicals
content of the river water, requiring constant readjustments in the
ratio of the six chemical comprising the spray repellent. The pilots
came from the U.S., Canada, Peru, Portugal, and the former
Yugoslavia. The ambassador told Kaplan how impressed he was by their
military discipline.</P>

<P>Though the pilots succeed in eradicating river blindness from the
immediate region, the disease could easily return to nearby Liberia
and Nigeria if the project was ever ended. "This is what it takes,"
said the ambassador, full of awe. "The highest levels of technology,
attention to the finest details, and the most extraordinary talent
and work ethic" are required to halt one disease, in one part of
Africa, temporarily. The ambassador went on to describe how the
pilots had been rising before dawn every day for a few years to be
briefed and to study their flight plans and computer printouts.
Western food was flown from Abidjan and trucked to their compounds.
The pilots had their own generators for electricity. The whole set-up
was like a base on the moon. (Kaplan 1996: 87-88)</P>

<P><TT>In their imaginations they saw the cinema as the total and
complete representation of reality; they saw in a trice the
reconstruction of a perfect illusion of the outside world in sound,
color and relief. - Andr&eacute; Bazin, 1946 (Bukatman 1993: 77)</TT>
</P>

<P><TT>But in the computer country, they dream of eliminating the
interface, of breaking down the barrier of the screen and eliminating
the distinctions made between this side and that side. - Karrie
Jacobs, 1990 (Bukatman 1993: 77)</TT></P>

<P>Virtual reality (VR)
<A NAME="18"></A><B><A HREF="vtpendno.htm#18">[18]</A></B>
technologies have attracted much attention at the beginning of the
1990's in attempting to simulate cyberspace. At this stage, the talk
surrounding the 'immersive interface' of virtual reality far
outstrips the achievements. The VR apparatus, bulky and inconvenient,
is far from the desired ideal of a 'transparent interface.' At the
same time the computational requirements to run these systems are so
intense as to put the experience out of reach for all but the
wealthiest, such as the military and entertainment clients. However,
it can be assumed that the technology will improve to the point of
widespread feasibility and affordability within a decade.</P>

<P>Yet, the mere existence of virtual reality raises important
questions. "Such ontological and epistemological structures as the
nature of the human, the real, experience, sensation, cognition,
identity and gender are all placed, if not under erasure then
certainly in question around the (still largely) discursive object of
virtual reality and the postulated existence of perfect, simulated,
environment. Virtual reality has become the very embodiment of
postmodern disembodiment." (Bukatman 1993: 78)</P>

<P>For me virtual reality becomes a powerful metaphor by which to
question the Western world's isolation from the social and economic
realities of the rest of the developing world. As the helicopter
story in the previous section illustrates, the Western world's
involvement with places like Africa is becoming more and more
detached and disembodied, not unlike an exploration into cyberspace.

<P>What the implosive SF of William Gibson's book <I>Neuromancer</I>
(1984) deals with is the invisible spaces of electronic circulation
or microscopic nanotechnologies. As such cyberpunk is concerned with
the intimacy of the contemporary interfaces that exist between human
subjects and electronic technology. [Figure 20]</P>

<P>In cyberpunk literature 'urban space' depicts more than just a
realistic milieu in which the punk protagonists fight out their
battles. It is the central metaphor used to describe the
phenomenologically relevant 'other space' of information circulation
and data control of today's electronic culture, coined by Gibson as
cyberspace. "Urban space and cyberspace become reciprocal metaphors –
each enables an understanding and negotiation of the other."
(Bukatman 1993: 145) Gibson's defined cyberspace as a consensual
hallucination -- a software meditation -- whose function is precisely
to provide that vision of, and entry into, the invisible -- but
actual -- world within the computer.</P>

<P>Cyberspace is thus an abstraction that provides a narrative
compensation of McLuhan's idea of the loss of visibility and space in
the technological, cybernetic world of today. It is a metaphor
attempting to recognize and overcome the technological estrangements
of the electronic age. In this way, cyberpunk becomes the defining
movement / element of contemporary society. Indeed, as Frederick
Jameson puts it, "cyberpunk is the supreme literary expression, if
not of postmodernism, then of late capitalism itself". (Jameson 1991:
419)</P>

<P>For the styling and design of Yield, I deliberately set out to
portray the banal 'hyper-reality' of the electronic 'cyberspace'
within the journey towards the data fields takes place. Unlike
big-budget Hollywood productions of the '90s (<I>Jurrasic Park</I>,
<I>Speed</I>, <I>Titanic</I>), wherein it becomes impossible to
discern computer generated images (CGI) from 'real' footage, Yield
draws from '80s films like <I>TRON</I> [Figure 22] and <I>The Last
Starfighter</I>. <I>TRON</I> was the first commercial film to rely on
entirely computer generated images and sequences. These effects were
characteristically too perfect to be accepted as 'facsimiles' of the
real world -- the surfaces were too smooth and undetailed, the
reflections were perfectly focussed, movements were unswerving and
non-inertial. The perfect coordinate space of the terminal field
allowed a precision of perspective that could not escape the ordinary
eye. "The body, with its analogic imperfections, is exempted from
this digital world -- contra <I>TRON's</I> narrative strategies, this
is precisely a disembodied space." (Bukatman1993: 88)</P>

<P>The slick, perfectly stylized machines appearing in <I>Yield</I>,
stood in sharp contrast to the organic, worked shapes and surfaces of
my sculptural objects. As one friend remarked: "...I just miss the
absolute raw power that is so present in your sculptures -- rough
hewn stone and welded steel. Your threeD [sic] world is very clean
and antiseptic."</P>
