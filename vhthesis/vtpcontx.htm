<P>Contextually, the <I>Virtual Harvester</I> project is situated
within my South African background. Living in South Africa, one is
reminded every day -- just by looking around oneself -- of Africa's
immense social and economic problems, having at its base a.o. dealing
with mass poverty. In post-apartheid South Africa the divide between
the rich and the poor, "the have and the have-nots", is perhaps in
the long run the biggest issue to solve.</P>

<P>However, "the have and the have-nots" issue is of global
importance, relating very much to post-industrial society and modern
information technology. As such the project continues with the themes
developed in <I>An Electronic Laager</I>, evoking thoughts on how the
information structures of society control human behaviour and action.
It is informed by the concept of the panopticon, serving as metaphor
for the anonymous centralisation of power, which accumulates in
today's global communication networks. An analogy can be drawn
between the 'panopticon'
<A NAME="29"></A><B><A HREF="vtpendno.htm#29">[29]</A></B> principle
as explained by Foucault in <I>Discipline and Punish</I> and
Baudrillard's phrase "neo-capitalist cybernetic order".
<A NAME="30"></A><B><A HREF="vtpendno.htm#30">[30]</A></B></P>

<P>The <I>Virtual Harvester</I> proceeds to question the motives of
the Western world's immersion in information technology, supposedly
constructing the global village. The work asks if the Western world
is not paradoxically isolating itself even further from the social
and economic realities of their impoverished neighbours. "Alongside
the ever-widening social divisions, another apartheid is being
created between the 'information-rich' and the
'information-poor.'"(Barbrook and Cameron 1995)</P>

<P>"In the twenty-first century, Africa, like Europe in the
twentieth, will have to be confronted. In my rucksack I carried a
letter from a friend, a U.S diplomat in the region. He writes: 'The
greatest threat to our value system comes from Africa. Can we
continue to believe in universal principles as Africa declines to
levels better described by Dante than by development economists? Our
domestic attitudes on race and ethnicity suffers as Africa becomes a
continent-wide 'Wreck of the Medusa.'"(Kaplan 1996:4)</P>

<P>In the section to follow I've taken random quotes from Robert
Kaplan's travelogue <I>The Ends of the Earth: A journey to the
frontiers of Anarchy</I> as well as from his article "The Coming
Anarchy " appearing in the <I>Atlantic Monthly</I>, February 1994.
Having travelled extensively through Africa and Asia, Kaplan's views
and insight corresponds greatly to and informed anew, many of my own
personal views regarding the current situation in sub-Saharan Africa
and the rest of the developing world.</P>

<P>Although I cannot claim to have travelled, read or experienced as
much as he has regarding the subject, I've grown up and lived in
South Africa for most of my life. I have travelled through most of
South Africa and through large parts of the rest of sub-Saharan
Africa (Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, Malawi, Kenya). Many of
the sights and impressions I got from these trips are echoed and
informed by Kaplan's writings. My aim is thus to provide a few pages
of 'impressions' regarding the state of the developing world,
particularly sub-Saharan Africa, in the wake of the Twenty-first
Century.</P>

<P>"I recalled a vision propounded to me by Thomas F. Homer-Dixon's ,
head of the Peace and Conflict Studies Programme at the University of
Toronto <A NAME="31"></A><B><A HREF="vtpendno.htm#31">[31]</A></B>:
'Think of a stretch limo in the potholed streets of New York City,
where homeless beggars live. Inside the limo are the air-conditioned
post-industrial regions of North America, Europe, the emerging
Pacific Rim, and a few other isolated places, with their trade
summitry and computer-information highways. Outside is the rest of
mankind, going in a completely different direction.'"(1996:10)

<P><B><TT><FONT SIZE="+1">7.1.2 The Statistics</FONT></TT></B></P>

<P>"The industrialized countries, which accounted for 40 percent of
the world's population after World War II, now account for only 20
percent, though they earn 85 percent of the world's income. In coming
decades, the industrialized world is expected to make up only 12 to
15 percent of the planetary population,
<A NAME="32"></A><B><A HREF="vtpendno.htm#32">[32]</A></B> as 90 to
95 percent of all births take place in the poorest countries. The
fact that this is happening at a time when income and life expectancy
rates worldwide are moving up illustrates just how uneven this
material growth has been, and how what is really growing is the
disparity between rich and poor. Never before -- not at the time of
various democratic revolutions in Central Europe in 1848 or at the
conclusion of World War I -- has wealth disparity been so great as
after the Cold War. And never before, because of the global
communications revolution, has this disparity been so visible."
(1996: 435)</P>

<P>"The rich nations of the industrialized world consume 70 percent
of the planets energy, 75 percent of its metals, and 85 percent of
its woods, according to the UN." (1996: 435)</P>

<P>"With 719,202,000 inhabitants out of a world population of
5,692,210,000 in 1995, Africans represented nearly 13 percent of
humanity. But this 13 percent contributed only 1.2 percent of the
world's gross domestic product, down from 1.8 percent in the 1980s.
Thus, as Africa's population relative to the rest of the world has
continued to soar, its contribution to the world's wealth has dropped
by a third in the past decade. Meanwhile, Africa's share of world
trade has fallen from 4 percent to near 2 percent. As per capita food
production in the rest of the developing world rose by 9 percent in
the 1980s, it decreased by 6 percent in Africa." (1996:11)
<A NAME="33"></A><B><A HREF="vtpendno.htm#33">[33]</A></B></P>

<P>When one looks at sub-Saharan Africa rather than Africa as a
whole, the situation becomes even more alarming. Sub-Saharan Africa's
population is growing at over 3 percent per year. That is nearly
double the planet's mean growth rate of 1.6 percent.
<A NAME="34"></A><B><A HREF="vtpendno.htm#34">[34]</A></B> With
little economic growth, sub-Saharan Africa's growing population is
sustained by slash-and-burn agriculture and the creation of shanty
towns that erode the continent's environmental base. (1996:12)</P>

<P><B><TT><FONT SIZE="+1">7.1.3 Urbanization</FONT></TT></B></P>

<P>To top it all, sub-Saharan Africa has the highest urban growth
rate of any region on the globe: 5.8 percent from 1965 to 1980, and
5.9 percent from 1980-1990, according to the World Bank. By the early
1980s, Kinshasa had a population of around 3 million, while
Johannesburg had over 1 million. Dakar, Nairobi, Dar es Selaam, and
Harare were not far behind. By 1990 one quarter of all Africans lived
in towns; by the end of the century the proportion will have risen to
one half.(1996:10)
<A NAME="35"></A><B><A HREF="vtpendno.htm#35">[35]</A></B></P>

<P>"For these newly urbanized peasants -- not just in Turkey, but in
Africa, in the Arab world, in India, and so many other places -- 'the
world was new,' writes V. S. Naipaul in <I>India: A Wounded
Civilization</I>. 'They saw themselves at the beginning of things:
unaccommodated men making a claim on their land for the first time,
and out of the chaos evolving their own philosophy of community and
self-help. For them the past was dead; they had left it behind in the
villages. Everywhere in the developing world at the end of the
twentieth century these new men and woman -- flowing into the cities,
turning them into grotesque villages -- were remaking civilization.
To these empowered millions, national borders, nations themselves,
even the idea of a nation, were vague. To them the real borders were
the most tangible and intractable ones -- those of culture. They
knew, for example, that the Christian Orthodox Greeks had once been
their enemy." (1996: 132)</P>

<P>In his book <I>War in the Age of Intelligent Machines</I>, Manuel
De Landa writes how the demographic turbulence produced by large
scale migration can in turn have a direct influence on warfare.
"Critical points in the growth of the urban masses are known to have
played a role in triggering wars throughout modern history. Whether
we consider demographic pressures as having 'creative' or
'destructive' effects will depend on our point of view. They are
creative to the extent that they influence the assembly of armies and
of war-related technology, but destructive in their ultimate
consequences." (De Landa 1991: 9)</P>

<P><B><TT><FONT SIZE="+1">7.1.4 Crime and Violent
Conflict</FONT></TT></B></P>

<P>This massive migration to cities in turn leads to a proliferation
of crime, conflict and violence. "Africa shows how the urban
environment may come to represent the locus of future conflict in the
developing world. The perpetrators of future violence will likely be
urban born, with no rural experience from which to draw." (1996: 12)
</P>

<P>"In many cases, it is precisely the unevenness of economic growth
within societies that is inflaming violent conflict. Karl Magyar,
professor of national security affairs at the U.S. military's Air
Command and Staff College, told an officers gathering in Boston in
1994 that much of the violence to unfold over the coming decades will
be ‘fuelled by rising expectations' rather than by mere poverty. In a
sense, the world economy has become a large version of
prerevolutionary Iran's, where in the 1960s and 1970s per capita
income rose from $200 to $1,000. But the rise was unevenly
distributed, and a large subproletariat was created in the process.
The result was upheaval." (1996: 387) [Figure 31]</P>

<P>"...where there has always been mass poverty, people find
liberation in violence....Physical aggression is a part of being
human. Only when people attain a certain economic, educational, and
cultural standard is this trait tranquilized. In the light of the
fact that 95 percent of the earth's population growth will be in the
poorest areas of the globe, the question is not whether there will be
war (there will be a lot of it) but what kind of war. And who will
fight whom ?" (1994: 16)</P>

<P>"As small-scale violence multiplies at home and abroad, state
armies will continue to shrink, being gradually replaced by a booming
private security business, as in West Africa, and by urban mafias,
especially in the former communist world, who may be better equipped
than municipal police forces to grant physical protection to local
inhabitants." (Kaplin 1994: 18) [Figure 32]</P>

<P>"The intense savagery of the fighting in such diverse cultural
settings as Liberia, Bosnia, the Caucasus, and Sri Lanka -- to say
nothing of what obtains in American inner cities -- indicates
something very troubling that those of us inside the stretch limo,
concerned with issues like middle-class entitlements and the future
of interactive cable television, lack the stomach to contemplate. It
is this: a large number of people on this planet, to whom the comfort
and stability of a middle-class life is utterly unknown, find war and
barracks existence a step up rather than a step down." (1994: 16)

<P>"Here were two people who understood that there were large swaths
of the earth at the end of the twentieth century that were not linked
by the Internet. In the course of my journeys in Africa and Asia, I
have gone into so many banks and hotels that had neither computers
nor typewriters that I no longer even noticed. The vast disparities
in the world following the collapse of communism and the end of the
Cold War, symbolized by a computer revolution in some parts of the
globe and the absence of reliable electric current in other parts,
was something that I took for granted because I was constantly
experiencing it." (1996: 320)</P>

<P><B><TT><FONT SIZE="+1">7.1.6 Versions of Reality</FONT></TT></B>
</P>

<P>"Africa offered several realities, I noticed. One was what I term
the 'VIP bubble,' within which the highest-ranking diplomats and
visiting emissaries experienced Africa. In this version of reality,
you are met at the airport by an embassy expediter, who escorts you
to a waiting area while he gets your passport stamped and afterwards
hustles you and your luggage through customs. Then a late-model
air-conditioned car, protected from soldiers by diplomatic license
plates, takes you to a five-star hotel or the ambassador's
residence." (1996: 41)</P>

<P><B><TT><FONT SIZE="+1">7.1.7 A New Aesthetic</FONT></TT></B></P>

<P>"At the end of the twentieth century I find almost nothing left to
photograph in my city. There are no aesthetics left here. Look at
this scene out of the car window. It's not a village, it's not a
city. It's just shit." -- Ara Gulger, a local Istanbul
photojournalist (1996: 131)</P>

<P>"To see the twenty-first century truly, one's eyes must learn a
different set of aesthetics. One must reject the overly stylized
images of travel magazines, with their inviting photographs of exotic
villages and glamourous downtowns. There are far too many millions
whose dreams are more vulgar, more real – whose raw energies and
desires will overwhelm the visions of the elites, remaking the future
into something frighteningly new." (1994: 11)</P>

<P>"West Africa is reverting to the Africa of the Victorian Atlas. It
consists now of a series of coastal trading posts, such as Freetown
and Conakry, and an interior that, owning to violence, volatility,
and disease, is again becoming, as Graham Greene once observed,
'blank' and 'unexplored.' However, whereas Greene's vision implies a
certain romance, as in the somnolent and charmingly seedy Freetown of
his celebrated novel <I>The Heart of the Matter</I>, it is Thomas
Malthus, the philosopher of demographic doomsday, who is now the
prophet of West Africa's future. And West Africa's future,
eventually, will also be that of most of the rest of the world."
(1994: 3)</P>

<P><B><TT><FONT SIZE="+1">7.1.8 Human Ingenuity</FONT></TT></B></P>

<P>"Optimists, like Wall Street strategist Barton Biggs, consider all
of this 'doom-and-gloom' stuff. Perhaps he's right. But what if he's
wrong, even partly wrong ?" (1996: 300)</P>

<P>"Homer-Dixon believes the world is headed for a split between
'those societies that can maintain an adequate supply of ingenuity
and those that cannot....We will probably see, for example, falling
grain prices and regional food surpluses in Western countries
occurring simultaneously with scarcity-induced civil strife in parts
of Africa and Asia.' He concludes that ''the optimism of neoclassical
economics...who have great faith in the potential of human ingenuity
when spurred by need is deceptive and imprudent. We are taking a huge
gamble if we follow the path they suggest, which is to wait till
scarcities are critical and watch human ingenuity burst forth in
response. Should it turn out, in the end, that this strategy was
wrong, we will not be able to return to a world resembling anything
like the one we have today...the soils, waters, and forests will be
irreversibly damaged, and our societies, especially the poorest ones,
will be so riven with discord that even heroic effort at social
renovation will fail." (1996: 350)</P>

<P>Another 'Doomslayer' as <I>Wired Magazine</I>
<A NAME="36"></A><B><A HREF="vtpendno.htm#36">[36]</A></B>
enthusiastically labelled him, is Julian Simon. According to Simon
additional human beings are good, not because it poses a problem of
additional mouths to feed, but because they grow up to be creative
adults who contribute and achieve and come up with creative new
ideas. "Resources come out of people’s minds more than out of the
ground or air", says Simon. "Minds matter economically as much as or
more than hands or mouths. Human beings create more than they use, on
average." (Regis 1997: 198) One example Simon gives is of the fertile
Midwestern prairie of America that was a malarial swamp before
settlers drained it.</P>

<P>The counter argument from Kaplan's book reads as follow: "There is
a new, fourth, school of environmental-population strategists, one
with which I felt increasingly comfortable as I travelled from Africa
to Asia. This school, which includes Toronto University's Thomas
Homer Dixon and others, agrees with neo-Malthusians that there are
limits to population growth beyond which poverty and social breakdown
result. It also agrees with neoclassical economists that the products
of human ingenuity can expand those limits to take people beyond mere
subsistence level, as in the case of the Industrial Revolution. But
this school believes that human ingenuity does not materialize
automatically and that some societies and cultures are more ingenious
than others. 'By definition,' writes Homer Dixon, developing
countries 'do not have the financial, material, or intellectual
resources of the developed world; furthermore, their social and
political institutions tend to be fragile and riven with discord.'"
(Kaplin 1996: 348)</P>

<P>"Though optimists have hopes for new resource technologies and
free-market development in the global village, they fail to note
that, as the National Academy of Sciences has pointed out, 95 percent
of the population increase will be in the poorest regions of the
world, where governments now -- just look at Africa -- show little
ability to function, let alone to implement even marginal
improvements." (1994: 8)</P>

<P><B><TT><FONT SIZE="+1">7.1.9 Western Response</FONT></TT></B></P>

<P>Kaplan makes an analogy between our progress today and the
progress of the ship in Joseph Conrad's <I>The Nigger of the
"Narcissus"</I>. Referring to the illness of one of the deck hands,
James Wait -- an African man dying of tuberculosis -- he says: "Like
the crew's confused and divided response to Wait's illness, our own
failure to respond intelligently to the issues raised by Africa's
decline betrays our own inner weaknesses."(1996:35)</P>

<P>"But I would be unfaithful to my experience if I thought we had a
general solution to these problems. <I>We are not in control</I>. As
societies grow more populous and complex, the idea that a global
elite like the UN can engineer reality from above is just as absurd
as the idea that political 'scientists' can reduce any of this to a
science." (Kaplin 1996: 436)</P>

<P>"Writing these words now, I am sure of one thing: that even as
some nations including the United States, may be retreating into a
fortresslike nationalism, this is only a temporary stage before the
world tide of population and poverty forces us all to realize that we
inhabit one increasingly small and crowded earth." (1996:9)</P>

<P><B><TT><FONT SIZE="+1">7.2. The Virtual Class</FONT></TT></B></P>

<P>In the introduction to their controversial article, <I>The
Californian Ideology</I>,
<A NAME="37"></A><B><A HREF="vtpendno.htm#37">[37]</A></B> Richard
Barbrook and Andy Cameron (members of the Hypermedia Research Centre
of the University of Westminster, London) writes: "On the West Coast,
skilled workers and entrepreneurs in the hypermedia industries form
the 'virtual class'. Like the 'labour aristocracy' of the last
century, core personnel in the media, computing and telecoms
experience both the insecurities and rewards of the marketplace. The
Californian Ideology reflects this ambiguity by simultaneously
advocating the New Left utopia of the electronic agora and the New
Right's vision of the electronic marketplace." (1995)</P>

<P>Under the heading "Cyborg Masters and Robot Slaves" Barbrook and
Cameron question the belief in the emancipatory potentiality of the
new information technologies made popular by McLuhan's dictum of the
global village. "Electronic media...abolish the spatial dimension...
By electricity, we everywhere resume person-to-person relations as if
on the smallest village scale. It is a relation in depth, and without
delegation of functions or powers... Dialogue supersedes the
lecture." (McLuhan 1968)</P>

<P>Instead Barbrook and Cameron envision the possibility of a more
oppressive version of our digital future, not unlike cyberpunk
fiction, where the technologies of freedom are turning into the
machines of dominance and control. To illustrate their concern they
refer to the man who embodies the right to democracy and freedom in
America: "At his estate at Monticello, Jefferson invented many clever
gadgets for his house, such as a 'dumb waiter' to deliver food from
the kitchen into the dining room. By mediating his contacts with his
slaves through technology, this revolutionary individualist spared
himself from facing the reality of his dependence upon the forced
labour of his fellow human beings. In the late-twentieth century,
technology is once again being used to reinforce the difference
between the masters and the slaves." (1995)</P>

<P>Barbrook and Cameron concludes their article, arguing that in a
time of increasing globalization of the world economy, serious debate
regarding our shared information future has never been more possible
or more necessary. Any programme dealing with the development of new
information technologies must ensure that the whole population are
included within the digital future and have access to the new on-line
services.</P>

<P>I share their belief in a mixed economy, thereby not letting to
the fluctuations of market forces determine everything. The digital
future in the developing world will probably be a hybrid of state
intervention, capitalist entrepreneurship and do-it-yourself culture.
"This alternative understanding of the future starts from a rejection
of any form of social apartheid -- both inside and outside
cyberspace." (1995)</P>
