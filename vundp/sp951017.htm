<H2>Message from James Gustave Speth for the International Day for the
Eradication of Poverty<BR>
</H2>

<P><I>New York, <B>17 October 1995</B></I></P>

<P><B>International Day for the Eradication of Poverty</B></P>

<P><B>Mr. James Gustave Speth</B> </P>

<P>Each day, 67,000 people are added to the ranks of the world's poor.
That means over the course of a year, nearly 25 million additional people
will be trapped in a life of substandard living conditions, hunger and
limited opportunities for a better life. Most of these people will be in
the developing world, and seven out of 10 will be female.</P>

<P>With the prospect of as many as 1.5 billion people living in poverty
by the year 2025, today should be marked as a day of alarm.</P>

<P>But it should also be marked as a day of optimism because the international
community has begun to work together to tackle this problem, which afflicts
all regions of the world.</P>

<P>At the Social Summit, which took place in Copenhagen last March, world
leaders came together to acknowledge the worsening problem of global poverty,
deplore its spread and commit themselves to actions to reverse the trend.
Never before have so many heads of state and government joined hands to
reach a consensus for building a poverty-free world.</P>

<P>The agreements reached in Copenhagen were revolutionary in their scope,
complexity and urgency. They recognized the key role to be played by people-centered
development in eradicating poverty and reminded all of us that escaping
poverty is about a lot more than higher incomes -- it is also about greater,
equity, opportunity and empowerment.</P>

<P>In Copenhagen, governments committed themselves to the goal of eradicating
poverty &quot;as an ethical, social, political and economic imperative
of humankind,&quot; by ensuring that &quot;people living in poverty have
access to productive resources, including credit, land, education and training,
technology, knowledge and information, and to public services.&quot;</P>

<P>One of the most important steps toward achieving these goals, according
to the Copenhagen agreements, is to formulate or strengthen national strategies
to reduce poverty and narrow the gap between the haves and the have-nots.
These strategies must have clear definitions of poverty and specific targets
for eradicating it. And, they must be formulated in partnership with civil
society and empower people, particularly women.</P>

<P>The United Nations Development Programme is committed to assisting governments
in the preparation of these strategies. We will offer both financial and
technical assistance to get the job done and to help countries formulate
and implement national policies that are conducive to equitable social
and economic advancement. A strong &quot;enabling environment&quot; that
supports growth; gives priority to the poor and to jobs and sustainable
livelihoods; and encourages participation, tolerance and respect for human
diversity and the rule of law, is absolutely central to any actions aimed
at eradicating poverty.</P>

<P>This enabling environment must promote justice and fundamental fairness
among nations as well as within them. This means strong countries giving
access to their markets to weaker countries. It means sharing modern technology.
And it means financial support for development assistance and debt relief.
Debt continues to cripple too many economies and prevents them from making
crucial investments in human development.</P>

<P>Poverty eradication will only be achieved and be sustainable if we attack
the root causes of poverty.</P>

<P>Eliminating poverty is the most important objective pursued by UNDP
through its commitment to sustainable human development. The priority we
assign to poverty eradication was endorsed by our Executive Board in June.
The other three main dimensions of UNDP's work are advancing women's role
in development, protecting and regenerating the environment, and creating
employment.</P>

<P>UNDP aims to bring its commitments to women, the environment, and jobs
into a broad drive to eliminate poverty. To succeed, UNDP will continue
to be an agency which pursues sustainable human development in all sectors,
all issues and all policies that have a substantial impact on the prospects
for poverty eradication and increased equity.</P>

<P>UN-sponsored conferences like the Social Summit, last year's International
Conference on Population and Development, and last September's Fourth World
Conference on Women, have called for interdisciplinary and multisectoral
responses to monumental development challenges. I believe we are beginning
to pull everything together and are seeing some real progress. Building
new alliances among UN agencies has been crucial to this end. UN agencies
just this week took a major step forward in building such alliances.</P>

<P>Several multi-agency task forces have been established to enable UN
development agencies and programs to take the lead in following up to commitments
made at the Social Summit and other international conferences. These task
forces will focus the UN system's energies on expanding basic socialservices
in developing countries, increasing access to productive assets and income,
and building an enabling environment -- all of which are critical components
of our collective responsibility to combat poverty.</P>

<P>Our goal for today -- and for the International Year for the Eradication
of Poverty, which begins in December -- is to maintain the momentum gained
in Copenhagen and to constantly search for innovative ways to transform
the concepts presented at Social Summit into a reality that lifts people
out of poverty, builds equity and -- more than anything else -- makes a
difference in peoples lives.<BR>
