<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="425">The United Nations General Assembly
has declared 1996 the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty.
UNDP Administrator James Gustave Speth has adopted poverty eradication
as the organization's &quot;job number one.&quot; But what does poverty
really mean? 
<P>When CHOICES asked that question of people around the world, their answers
were often startling in their eloquence and simplicity. They were also
as varied as societies themselves. In many instances, poverty was defined
as a scourge that denies people a minimum level of income and the basic
necessities of life, such as food, clothing and shelter. But it also went
much deeper than that. One metaphor for poverty that appeared more than
once was that of a dark hole, from which people were unable to emerge.
For indigenous peoples, it meant destruction of nature, which for them
represents wealth. For still others, it meant the loss of freedom, dignity
and basic human rights. Mahatma Gandhi was said to have described poverty
as &quot;the worst form of violence.&quot; </P>

<P>On 17 October, the day set aside to mark the international year, people
around the globe will be launching national campaigns to fight poverty
in all of its forms. As a point of departure, CHOICES is pleased to present
the following essay -- a collection of voices from around the globe. </P>
