<H2>UNDP EVENTS AROUND THE WORLD MARK 17 OCTOBER AS DAY FOR POVERTY ERADICATION
</H2>

<H3>Historic Day Leads to Wide Range of Global Activities </H3>

<P><I>New York, <B>17 October 1996</B></I> -- United Nations Development
Programme offices around the world have declared the week of 17-24 October
&quot;Poverty Week&quot;. Special events will help publicize the plight
of the 1.3 billion people who live on less than US$1 a day, and the need
for global and local actions to counter poverty's harsh effects. On 17
October, the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, UNDP will
help sponsor activities in over 100 countries to mark this historic occasion
of international solidarity against poverty. </P>

<P>James Gustave Speth, Administrator of UNDP, emphasized in a statement
released today that the world has the material and natural resources, the
know-how and the people to make a poverty-free world a reality. &quot;We
have committed the full force of all our energies to fight poverty, the
gravest challenge of our time,&quot; Mr. Speth said.</P>

<P>UNDP has targeted poverty eradication as its top priority, and is engaged
in a coordinated effort by the UN system to help governments attack its
root causes and harsh consequences. </P>

<P>On 17 October, an interfaith service will be held at the UN Church Center
in New York, organized by UNDP and the World Conference on Religion and
Peace. That same day Mr. Speth will meet with representatives of 150 NGOs
to mobilize civil society in the fight against poverty. He will also address
press at a noon briefing at the UN. </P>

<P>Mayors of 40 cities in the US and Canada, among them New York, Philadelphia
and Washington, DC, have joined a drive launched by UNDP and proclaimed
17 October as Poverty Eradication Day. </P>

<P>UNDP has invited staff of all UN agencies around the world to make a
donation to anti-poverty projects and to fast on 18 October. </P>

<P>UNDP and the UNA-USA will announce winners of the Students Against Poverty
Contest in the US -- a competition to come up with ideas to help combat
poverty in their communities. </P>

<P>In more than 100 countries, tens of thousands of people are participating
in sports and cultural events -- walks, runs, football and handball matches,
music and art festivals, and even a calypso contest -- to publicize Poverty
Eradication Day. In some countries citizens will distribute food and clothing
to vulnerable groups and communities in need. People from all walks of
life are taking part in the many events, including presidents and mayors,
representatives from youth and women's organizations, UN officials and
representatives from media and NGOs. </P>

<P>Additionally, to stimulate debate on poverty eradication, UNDP has selected
poverty as the theme for the 1997 <I>Human Development Report.</I></P>

<P>&quot;Unless we address the problems of poverty right now, none of the
great goals the international community has set -- peace, stability, human
rights for all, preservation of the environment -- are achievable&quot;,
said Mr. Speth.</P>

<P>The UN General Assembly, in resolution 50/107, established 1996 as the
International Year for the Eradication of Poverty, and 1996-2006 as the
International Decade for the Eradication of Poverty.</P>
