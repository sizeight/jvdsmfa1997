Gustave Speth, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme,
has turned on a poverty clock, which shows that every day, 67,000 people
join the ranks of the world's poor. The clock is part of the commemoration
of 1996 as the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty. &quot;The
world has the material and natural resources, the know-how and the people
to make a poverty-free world a reality,&quot; Mr. Speth said. &quot;One
hundred and sixty years ago, the world launched a world crusade against
slavery. Today I call upon you to launch a similar crusade--for a world
without poverty.&quot;</P>

Bangira , a Zimbabwean mother of four, says she is escaping poverty thanks
to an irrigation project that has enabled her to grow more vegetables.
Ms. Bangira speaks in front of the &quot;poverty clock&quot; of the United
Nations Development Programme. The clock started 1:30 p.m. on January 17
and will run throughout 1996, the year designated by the United Nations
as the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty. The clock shows
that every day, another 67,000 people join the ranks of the world's poor.
Ms. Bangira says that last year's harvest was good, despite a drought that
struck much of Southern Africa.</P>

resident of the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, Lenore Cola says
that community organizations are helping her lift herself out of poverty
and recover from five years of homelessness. Ms. Cola speaks in front of
the &quot;poverty clock&quot; of the United Nations Development Programme.
The clock started 1:30 p.m. on January 17 and will run throughout 1996,
the year designated by the United Nations as the International Year for
the Eradication of Poverty. The clock shows that every day, another 67,000
people join the ranks of the world's poor. &quot;Poverty takes away your
dignity, your self-respect,&quot; the New Orleans-born mother of three
said. &quot;It makes you feel less of a person.&quot;</P>

Ticona Mamani, from the Aymara highlands of Bolivia, says a development
project supported by the United Nations Development Programme has helped
4,000 impoverished families triple their incomes. Mr. Ticona Mamani speaks
in front of UNDP's &quot;poverty clock,&quot; which started 1:30 p.m. on
January 17 and will run throughout 1996, the year designated by the United
Nations as the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty. The clock
shows that every day, another 67,000 people join the ranks of the world's
poor. Mr. Ticona Mamani says the project enabled herdsmen to boost production
and quality of alpaca wool for export</P>
