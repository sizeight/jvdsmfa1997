<H2>OLYMPIC MEDALLISTS JOIN INTERNATIONAL APPEAL AGAINST POVERTY</H2>

<P><B>Appeal launched in Atlanta by United Nations Development Programme
and International Olympic Committee </B></P>

<P><I>Atlanta, <B>30 July 1996</B></I> -- Dozens of Olympic medal winners
have pledged to support a global drive against poverty by signing an appeal
launched by UNDP and the International Olympic Committee (IOC). A massive
billboard in Atlanta's Olympic Village that posts the text of the appeal
has been signed by thousands of athletes. The medallists include: </P>

<P>Dominique Dawes, USA, gymnastics (gold/bronze); Shannon Miller, USA,
gymnastics (gold); Charles Austin, USA, high jump (gold); Brad Bridgewater,
USA, swimming (gold); John Hargis, USA, swimming (gold); Marie Jose Perec,
France, 400m (gold); Claudia Poll, Costa Rica, swimming (gold); Jefferson
Perez, Ecuador, 200 km walk (gold); Saphir Suleymanoglu, Turkey, weightlifting
(gold); Tripp Schwenk, USA, swimming (gold/silver); Irina Gerasimenok,
Russia, shooting (silver); Frankie Fredericks, Namibia, 100m (silver);
Paul Tergat, Kenya, 10,000m (silver); Ana Fidelia Quirot, Cuba, 800m (silver)
Giles Bosquet/Bertrand Vectan, France, rowing (silver). Maria Mutola, Mozambique,
800 meters (bronze); Salah Hissou, Morocco, 10,000m (bronze); Frederic
Kowal, France, rowing (bronze).</P>

<P>Other athletes who have joined the appeal, from the US, include Grant
Hill, basketball, Kelly Blair, heptathlon, and Sheila Hudson, triple jump.
Ethiopian track stars Haile Gebrselassie and Derartu Tulu have also added
their names to the drive against poverty. </P>

<P>One in five people lives in absolute poverty today, 900 million adults
cannot read or write and 1.3 billion people do not have access to safe
water. Pledging to join the battle against poverty reflects the Olympic
ideals of human dignity and well-being. The UN General Assembly proclaimed
1997-2006 as the International Decade for the Eradication of Poverty, following
the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty, 1996. The appeal
launched by the IOC and UNDP coincides with these drives. </P>

<P>Athletes who sign up pledge to help fight poverty, promote solidarity
and human development. They also seek to promote development, rally public
opinion and call for national and international actions as they request
societies to make the fight against poverty an absolute priority. Already,
national Olympic committees and UNDP offices in 40 countries have begun
collaborating to promote greater access to sports by poor people, as well
as new projects to combat poverty at the local level. </P>

<P>Upon signing the large billboard in Olympic Village, Moses Kiptanui,
the 3,000 meter steeplechase contender from Kenya, said that poverty is
killing human progress, and makes people fight each other. &quot;People
should be exposed to different societies and sports is the best way to
get people together. It is not my will to become a great athlete. My will
is to help people through sports. I am running for them, and I only feel
useful if I can do something for the poor communities in my country,&quot;
he said.</P>

<P>Other Kenyan Olympic team members who have signed the appeal include
Paul Bitok, Joseph Gykonio, Linu Kimutai and Vincent Malakwan. From Switzerland,
the cyclist Alex Zulle has joined the appeal, as has the Spanish marathon
runner Rocio Rios and Colombian high jump contender Gilmar Mayo.</P>

<P>&quot;This appeal comes at a time when poverty has become the greatest
challenge facing the planet,&quot; said the Administrator of UNDP, James
Gustave Speth. &quot;It endangers the future of all our children and of
coming generations. Drastic measures are needed at national and international
levels to avoid carrying this deprivation well into the next century.&quot;
The fight to end poverty is also a matter of individual civic responsibility,
Mr. Speth said. This is why UNDP and the IOC are developing a joint programme
of action to stimulate grassroots initiatives throughout the world and
to inform the public about the nature of poverty and solutions.</P>
