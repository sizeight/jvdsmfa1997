<H2>International Day<BR>
for the Eradication of Poverty</H2>

<P><BR>
<I>New York, <B>17 October 1996</B></I></P>

<P><B>Message from James Gustave Speth<BR>
Administrator, United Nations Development Programme</B></P>

<P>Today marks the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. On
this day, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) re-dedicates
itself to a decade-long, global effort to replace hunger, helplessness
and despair with opportunity, hope and the promise of a better future.
Poverty places an intolerable burden on the human spirit. We cannot accept
that it will always be with us. The modern world has the resources, the
know-how and the expertise to relegate poverty to the pages of history.
That is why UNDP, with the enthusiastic backing of our Executive Board,
has made the fight against world poverty its central and overriding priority.
UNDP now spends nearly 90 per cent of its core resources in countries with
90 per cent of the world's poorest people. We have committed the full force
of all our energies to the gravest human challenge of our time--an effort
which will also galvanize and energize the various efforts of the United
Nations around a great and just cause. </P>

<P>Picture a moment what being poor really means--beyond the vast numbers
of nameless, faceless people who many think live only in faraway places.
Poverty is a hungry and thirsty child who cannot understand why there is
no food and no water. Poverty is an elderly woman with no heat in winter,
a woman with a lifetime of hard work behind her and only a damp chill as
her reward. Poverty is a fisherman whose waters--and livelihood--have been
spoiled by pollution through no fault of his own. But being poor is more
than a lack of food, shelter and livelihoods. Poverty means marginalization--the
exclusion of millions of people in countries, rich and poor, from the benefits
of progress. Poverty also means polarization--the growing gap between the
haves and the have-nots, both between countries and within countries. </P>

<P>Inequities breed joblessness and hopelessness, anger and despair--and
all too often violence and conflict. The world must make a place for everyone
to share in its bounty. And the poor need more control over the forces
shaping their lives. They need the opportunity to lift themselves out of
poverty and social exclusion and enter a world of equity and justice. </P>

<P>The income gap between the richest and poorest 20 per cent of the world's
people has not been narrowing in the past 30 years. It has, in fact, doubled.
Each day, 68,000 people join the ranks of the poor--families living on
less than one dollar a day. Let us ask ourselves what the future could
possibly hold for the children in these families.</P>

<P>The goal to eradicate extreme poverty is not some lofty idealism when
we see how many industrial countries over the course of this century have
done just that. In this sense, conquering poverty is not just a moral imperative
but a feasible objective.</P>

<P>With the spirit of the 1995 Copenhagen World Summit on Social Development
as our guide and inspiration, UNDP is helping to forge a world partnership
geared to replacing poverty with equity. We have set our goals to provide
sustainable livelihoods, to advance the well-being of women and to regenerate
the environment.</P>

<P>UNDP offices throughout the world are sponsoring and organizing events
to observe the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. The activities,
which take place during the week of 17-24 October, are designed to encourage
and assist governments and their people to develop national poverty eradication
strategies as well as plans of actions which are comprehensive, participatory
and realistic. </P>

<P>Within this framework, UNDP is working with governments to help them
identify the nature and scope of poverty in their respective countries.
We are supporting initiatives that provide equitable access to assets including
skills, credit, jobs and sustainable livelihoods, land and environmental
resources, linkages to national and international markets and information
systems, citizenship rights and legal rights for women and minorities.
</P>

<P>The real potential of the next century will not be found in stocks or
technology or minerals. The real potential of the future will be found
in the three billion people now living in poverty who collectively represent
the greatest potential for growth and opportunity the world has ever seen.</P>

<P>Unless we address the problems of poverty now, none of the great goals
the international community has set--peace, stability, human rights for
all, preservation of the environment--are achievable in a world where one
half of the people find themselves shut out of opportunity and the benefits
of a global society.</P>

<P>Poverty is the great denier. It denies comfort, dignity, freedom, participation.
Today we deny the great denier its handiwork. I call upon every individual
who cares about justice and human dignity to join the global campaign to
eradicate poverty. We have the know-how. We have the resources. Today,
we need the commitment. <BR>
