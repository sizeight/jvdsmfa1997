<P>&quot;I have seen poverty all over the world -- villages, suburbs and
cities, at home and abroad. I've seen babies with swollen bellies, mothers
who can't obtain health care for a sick child, girls who are denied the
right to attend school and families who are forced to live on top of disease-laden
sewage canals because they lack the political clout to bring about change
on their own behalf. Poverty can mean that a child with promise as a pianist
will never feel the keys under her hand and that a father who struggles
to earn a living will never make enough to send a deserving child to high
school or college. It can mean that a community fighting to survive will
not be able to organize itself to confront its social or economic problems.</P>

<P>&quot;We can only overcome the scourge of poverty if, as a global family
of nations, we commit to investing in the world's greatest resource: our
people. Giving all men, women and children the tools of opportunity --
education, health care, employment, legal rights and political freedoms
-- does not just serve humanitarian purposes. It is the key to economic,
social and political progress. When individuals flourish, families flourish.
And when families flourish, communities and nations will flourish as well.&quot;
-- <I>Hillary Rodham Clinton, First Lady of the USA</I></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty is the denial of all human rights. It is not created by
the poor. It is created and sustained by the 'system' we have built around
us.&quot; -- <I>Muhammad Yunus, Managing Director, Grameen Bank, Bangladesh</I></P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/djib.jpg" HEIGHT=279 WIDTH=400 ALIGN=ABSCENTER></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty means you live in huts with grass thatched roofs. The
poor carry water in clay pots rather than in modern but expensive jerrycans.
Even pots used for cooking are homemade. The poor receive from the rich
and have to eat cassava.&quot; -- <I>Jackline Namutosi, age 8, Kampala,
Uganda</I></P>

<P>&quot;Wealth is a blanket we wear (the land). Poverty is to have that
blanket taken away.&quot; -- <I>John Hardbattle, founder, First Peoples
of the Kalahari, Botswana</I></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty to me is the situation of the least developed countries.
The state of these countries is the ultimate test of the world's social
and economic health.&quot; -- <I>Kari Nordheim-Larsen, Minister of Development
Cooperation, Norway</I></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty means ill-health, which prevents you from working.&quot;

<P>&quot;I am cooking now and I don't know when next I'll cook a proper
meal and when I'll be able to live in a proper place; that is poverty.
I am squatting because landlords would not accept me with eight children.
It is depressing and frustrating.&quot; -- <I>Shirley Jupiter, single mother
of eight, Ruimveldt squatters settlement, Georgetown, Guyana</I></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty ... means powerlessness and low status. It means a culture
of silence. It means bearing children on the street. It means the lack
of privacy, dignity and any kind of security.&quot; -- <I>Mahila Milan
(a women's collective of pavement dwellers), Bombay, India</I></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty to me is being enslaved to seeking a crumb of bread instead
of freedom to love and enjoy life.&quot; -- <I>Jalal Baayo, dentist, Tripoli,
Libya</I></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty, in the end, is a state of dispossession and deprivation
in which people are not only deprived of their income, but also of opportunity,
empowerment and, most important, dignity.&quot; -- <I>James Gustave Speth,
Administrator, United Nations Development Programme</I></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty may be defined as a state of physical, spiritual or financial
deprivation, preventing people from attaining their full potential and
realizing their self-fulfilment.&quot; -- <I>Navinchandra Ramgoolam, Prime
Minister of the Republic of Mauritius </I></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty is a cancer that gnaws at the fabric of society and threatens
peace on a worldwide scale.&quot; -- <I>Jean-Bertrand Aristide, former
President of Haiti</I></P>

economic status and a child every year.&quot; -- <I>Hira Kumari Maharjan,
age 40, housewife and volunteer social worker, Nepal</I></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty means never having quite enough to eat.&quot; -- <I>Kevin
McDonald, panhandler, New York City</I></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty is crisis. Beans at 35 lempiras, that alone empties the
account. Giving a child half an egg because of how much they cost -- that,
too, is poverty, and then they don't even let us work.&quot; -- <I>Mar&iacute;a
Antonia Padilla, fruit seller and single mother with three dependent children,
Tegucigalpa, Honduras </I></P>

<P>&quot;Watching my mother struggle on little or nothing to provide her
children with a decent standard of living.&quot; -- <I>Anonymous student,
age 13, Barbados</I></P>

<P>&quot;An individual living in a state of poverty is unable to provide
for his or her most basic necessities: food, shelter and clothing. The
inherent potential of a human being never gets an opportunity to emerge
as life becomes a constant struggle for survival.&quot; -- <I>Arzu Rana
Deuba, First Lady of Nepal</I></P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/thai.jpg" HEIGHT=278 WIDTH=400 ALIGN=ABSCENTER></P>

<P>&quot;To me real poverty is a poor woman. If she who bears the brunt
of poverty becomes poor, then humankind is finished. I say this because
the problems of poverty are always dumped on women. They usually do a good
job anyway, so humankind survives.&quot; -- <I>Baboucar Gaye, journalist,
the Gambia</I></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty is a woman sending her children out to beg in traffic
rather than to school because otherwise there will be nothing to eat. The
mother knows she is repeating a cycle that trapped her, but there is no
way out that she can see.&quot; -- <I>Alicia Gentolia, urban social worker,
Philippines</I></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty is not realizing your own intrinsic wealth.&quot; -- <I>Murray
Hochman, artist, New York City </I></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty is being stuck in a deep hole, being able to see the light
and people freely walking around, but not having the voice to shout for
help or a ladder to climb out.&quot; -- <I>Abdulrazak Raubi, systems analyst,
Zueitina Oil Company, Tripoli, Libya</I></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty is the situation of someone who has no support and no
one they can count on for the future.&quot; -- <I>Anonymous, Kayesi, Mali</I></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty means that God forgives our thefts.&quot; -- <I>Tony,
homeless &quot;street kid,&quot; age 10, Angola</I></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty to me is the impossibility of living in your own home.
It is life in a refugee camp and the lack of opportunity for my children
to get a proper education.&quot; -- <I>Vugar Ibrahimov, age 42, refugee
from Azerbaijan</I></P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/azer1.jpg" HEIGHT=282 WIDTH=400 ALIGN=ABSCENTER></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty is having to take from the rich to be able to eat.&quot;

Colombia</I></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty is what forced me to leave school and work in the central
market.&quot;--<I>Anonymous, age 15, Bahrain</I></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty expands whenever society sinfully undermines the human
right to realize oneself spiritually, socially and economically.&quot;
-- <I>Halfdan Mahler, MD, Director-General Emeritus, World Health Organization</I></P>

<P>&quot;If I have food, music and brandy, there is no poverty for me.&quot;
-- <I>Anonymous Gypsy, Bulgaria</I></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty is the squatter mother whose hut has been torn down by
the government for reasons she cannot understand. That night she sits amid
the ruins of her home, listening to her children coughing in the dark.
She doesn't know what will happen the next day, but she fears it will be
worse than what happened that day.&quot; -- <I>Dennis Murphy, Coordinator,
Urban Poor Associates, the Philippines</I></P>

<P>&quot;For me poverty is a kind of deprivation from something which every
human being has a natural right to have... the poverty of the lonely, the
unloved, the outcast -- the unwanted -- who are hungry not only for bread
but for love. I think the poorest of the poor are those who are not yet
touched -- rather, those who have not allowed themselves to be touched
-- by God's love....&quot; -- <I>Mother Teresa, Calcutta, India</I></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty means waking up without perspective. It is a state in
which you feel degraded, and as a result, rejected by society. Poverty
robs you of your aspirations for the future.&quot; -- <I>Zelda Alfred,
Representative of Tobago's Association of NGOs, Trinidad and Tobago</I></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty is lack of opportunity, lack of freedom. It is hunger
and malnutrition, disease and lack of basic social services. It is a policy
failure that degrades people -- those who suffer it, and those who tolerate
it. It is an equity gap between countries and within countries. Poverty
is still the gravest insult to human dignity. Poverty is the scar on humanity's
face.&quot; -- <I>Gro Harlem Brundtland, Prime Minister of Norway</I></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty to me means working for more than 18 hours per day, but
still not earning enough to feed myself, my wife and two children.&quot;
-- <I>Rudeen Kean, age 28, cyclo driver, Phnom Penh, Cambodia</I></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty is the destruction of nature: the forest, land, animals,
rivers and lakes.&quot; -- <I>Elsa Scadd, Amerindian, age 66, Amerindian
Research Unit, University of Guyana, Guyana</I></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty means that your children are crying and you have nothing
to feed them.&quot; -- <I>Nadejda Chirica, Deputy Chief, Division of the
Department of Foreign Economic Relations, Ministry of Economy, Chisinau,
Moldova</I></P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/niger1.jpg" HEIGHT=270 WIDTH=400 ALIGN=ABSCENTER></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty is to be marginalized, to be deprived of the freedom to
choose and of the hope for change. Suppressing the reality of poverty is
the strongest shield of the privileged against change. This is true for
nations and for individuals. Change is a moral imperative.&quot; -- <I>Poul
Nielson, Minister for Development Cooperation, Denmark</I></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty is hunger, illness and the lack of opportunity for a child
to reach his or her potential.&quot; -- <I>Charles F. MacCormack, President,
Save the Children Foundation, USA</I></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty is a serious crime. It causes you to do bad things. It
encourages people to live in bondage.&quot; -- <I>Dembo Singhateh, the
Gambia</I></P>

<P>&quot;Poverty is a hidden feeling of inferiority which makes a person
feel different from others....&quot;--<I>Dahi L. Al-Fadhli, economist,
Kuwait</I></P>
