<H2>Poverty Eradication</H2>

<P>"At its core, development must be about improvement of human well being;
removal of hunger, disease and ignorance; and productive employment for
all. Its first goal must be to end poverty and satisfy the priority needs
of all people in a way that can be productively sustained over future generations."

<P>"Within the sustainable human development framework, we must give top
priority to the eradication of poverty. Of our four goals, it is listed
first for a reason. Let us make it clear that UNDP is the UN's anti-poverty
organization -- a world partnership against poverty."</P>

<P>— <I><FONT SIZE=-1>James Gustave Speth<BR>
Administrator<BR>
April 1995</FONT></I></P>

<P>Over the past 30 years, developing countries have made remarkable progress
in raising average incomes, reducing infant mortality, increasing life
expectancy and boosting adult literacy. The 1994 Human Deve- lopment Report,
produced for UNDP by an independent team of development consultants, notes
that while about 73 per cent of the world's population was ranked as having
low human development in 1960, by 1990 that figure had shrunk to 35 per
cent. </P>

<P>But despite these achievements, poverty remains a paramount challenge
for national governments, as well as for the international development
community. In all developing regions except East Asia, the number of poor
people has been rising since the 1980s. Today, more than one out of five
people around the world are living in conditions of extreme poverty, on
little more than US$1.00 a day. </P>

<P>Failure to diminish poverty has become a threat to all countries, rich
and poor. As Mahbub ul Haq, Special Adviser to the UNDP Administrator and
architect of the Human Development Report has put it, "Poverty is no longer
contained within national boundaries. It has become globalized. It travels
across borders, without a passport, in the form of drugs, diseases, pollution,
migration, terrorism and political instability."</P>

<H4>Poverty's complex nature</H4>

<P>Poverty is a complex and multi-dimensional phenomenon resulting from
deeply imbedded structural imbalances in all realms of human existence
— the state, the economy, society, culture and the environment. More often
than not, people in poverty are malnourished and have inadequate shelter.
With little or no access to basic social services, they do not enjoy good
health and are poorly educated.</P>

<P>But poverty entails far more than lack of income sufficient to cover
subsistence needs. Deprived of equitable access to markets and institutions,
people in poverty suffer from marginalization and social exclusion. Poverty
also reflects the lack of political clout among those whom it affects --
a power gap that keeps people living in poverty isolated, vulnerable and
unable to lift themselves out of their situation. </P>

<P>Securing a decent livelihood for people living in poverty requires attacking
the many interrelated forces that conspire to keep them in a state of deprivation.
Above all, it requires expanding people's access to participation in decision-making
and to knowledge, training and markets and other productive resources for
income generation such as land, technology, credit and information.</P>

<H4>UNDP's new approach</H4>

<P>Improving the living standards of people in developing countries, especially
the most deprived groups, has always been a main goal of UNDP technical
cooperation. Projects focusing on rural development, credit, micro-enterprise
promotion and basic needs have traditionally enabled many to better their
lives. In the 1990s, poverty alleviation has become a <B>top UNDP priority</B>,
featured in the vast majority of the fifth cycle (1992-1996) country programmes
and continuing to grow in importance. </P>

<P>The programmes UNDP supports <B>build national capacities</B> — <B>and
facilitate countries' own efforts</B> — for overcoming poverty. First and
foremost they aim to assist governments and organizations of civil society
in developing economic and social policies and programmes that benefit
people living in poverty. People-centred, they address the whole range
of factors contributing to poverty, seeking to increase food security;
improve the availability and quality of shelter and basic services; generate
opportunities for employment and sustainable livelihoods; empower women
and men through access to assets and productive resources such as land,
credit, technology, training and markets; and enable people to participate
in the political forces that shape their lives. Emphasis is on:</P>

<P>• <B>multi-sectoral approaches</B>, in line with the growing acceptance
of poverty as a multi-dimensional problem. The focus is on activities that
link relief to development, seeking to improve people's capacity for self-reliance
by expanding their access to decision-making, markets and services. Integrated
area-based programmes are already having a positive impact in Central American
nations, Sudan and Cambodia.</P>

<P>• strengthening national abilities for <B>data-gathering and analysis
of poverty indicators</B> (as a first step for effective policy design),
and for conducting <B>poverty</B> assessment studies and developing comprehensive,
country-wide <B>macro-level anti-poverty strategies.</B> This is being
done in countries including <B>Burkina Faso, The Gambia, Ghana, Indonesia,
Mongolia, Nepal,</B> the <B>Philippines</B> and <B>Zimbabwe.</B> </P>

<P>•<B> community participation.</B> Bottom-up planning is encouraged by
involving target groups in all stages of programmes they themselves identify,
by support for the decentralization of authority, and by strengthening
the links between grassroots communities and local government agencies.
UNDP-supported small-grants programmes such as <B>Partners in Development,
Local Initiative Facility for Urban Environment and Africa 2000</B> encourage
local decision-making, strengthen the institutional capacity of community
groups and NGOs and promote networking between them and government agencies.
</P>

<P>• <B>ensuring sustainability.</B> Moving away from earlier emphasis
on the direct provision of services to poor communities, UNDP is improving
the abilities of public sector and local institutions to provide such services
on a sustained basis. A deliberate effort is made to widen the range of
development partners by involving both government institutions and organizations
of civil society in policy dialogue and programme execution. </P>

<P>• <B>regional actions,</B> ranging from policy advocacy on major issues
such as the effects of structural adjustment on people living in poverty,
to region-wide consensus-building for poverty eradication and human development,
and to the exchange and dissemination of information on innovative approaches
to poverty alleviation.</P>

<P>• strengthening <B>cooperation with other UN organizations,</B> to ensure
coordinated approaches and a sharing of resources for poverty reduction
programmes. </P>

<P>• <B>sustainable livelihoods</B>. UNDP has expanded its concern with
jobs and income to include the broader concepts of sustainable livelihoods
and people's empowerment. People, not goods, must be at the centre of all
development efforts. The ultimate goal of development is not merely to
raise average incomes, but to enlarge people's choices and opportunities
to lead creative and productive lives through freely chosen employment
and freedom from want. This implies development that ensures sustainable
use of natural resources; that addresses the special needs and utilizes
the untapped potentials of women; that recognizes the need for people living
in poverty to participate in governance and decisions that affect their
lives; and that shows concern for basic human rights, legal protection
and public safety while respecting cultural diversity and human dignity.</P>

<P>This message is at the heart of UNDP's policy dialogue with governments
that request assistance in identifying the root causes of poverty, formulating
national anti-poverty strategies and programmes and integrating them into
overall economic and social policy and planning. UNDP also helps interested
countries mobilize technical and financial resources for such programmes
and promotes the exchange of their experiences. </P>

<H4>Support for national efforts</H4>

<P>A regional project on critical poverty in <B>Latin America and the Caribbean</B>
UNDP launched in 1986 helped to place poverty high on the region's development
agenda. It analyzed the impact of debt and adjustment on living conditions;
developed methodologies for measuring poverty and its changes over time;
compiled and updated detailed information on poverty trends; and proposed
a number of policy options to deal selectively with differ-ent categories
of people living in poverty. Building upon this initiative, UNDP and the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) are further analyzing poverty alleviation
and social development programmes and their relationship to economic development.
A February 1993 Social Forum brought together minsters of finance, planning,
social affairs and other sectors with a wide range of civil society representatives
to discuss experiences to-date. The meeting's report, Social Reform and
Poverty: Towards a Comprehensive Agenda for Development, resulted in the
IDB Governing Board's approving new targets for social sector lending and
setting the stage for joint UNDP-IDB social development programming.</P>

<P>In <B>Sri Lanka</B> the Janasaviya Trust Fund (JTF), one of the country's
most prominent NGO support organizations, is a key instrument of the government's
anti-poverty strategy. An $87 million project funded by the World Bank,
the government and Germany aims to build the capacity of the JTF to support
NGO partner organizations as they deliver credit, training and other services
to people living in poverty, and to enable the NGOs themselves to operate
more efficiently. UNDP funds technical assistance for the project, supplementing
this with support for an Employment and Poverty Policy Unit in Sri Lanka's
Ministry of Policy Planning and Implementation.</P>

<P>In just six years, <B>Mongolia's</B> Poverty Alleviation Programme aims
to reduce the number of people living in poverty from 26.5 per cent to
10 per cent or less. Its focus is on policy management and institutional
strengthening; economic growth and employment promotion; protection of
human capital (for example, through better access to health care and education);
improving living conditions for women and rural residents and strengthening
the social safety net. </P>

<P>Area Development Schemes (ADS), based on a participatory and environmentally
sustainable approach to the eradication of poverty are being carried out
in five drought-prone rural areas of <B>Sudan</B>. Developed with several
other UN agencies, the schemes have benefitted about half a million people
in 2000 of the country's poorest villages. Participants have been mobilized,
organised and trained to select, implement and manage activities through
Village Development Committees, over 30 per cent of whose members are women.
Credit comes from revolving funds jointly financed by the communities and
UNDP. Fields covered include agriculture, afforestation, water supply,
handicrafts, small-scale industry, and other income generating pursuits.
A share of profits is used to meet community health and education needs.
The programme offers useful lessons in how to move from relief to development.</P>

<P>In <B>Malawi</B> UNDP, with other UN partners, succeeded in building
strong commitment to poverty alleviation within the new government. This
was achieved through a UNDP-supported analysis of the national poverty
situation that included proposals for redressing negative social sector
trends. The entire UNDP country programme is now devoted to poverty alleviation,
which has become a key national development objective. </P>

<P>A statistical study in <B>Indonesia </B>covered social conditions in
27 provinces where more than 35 million people live in poverty. The data
it provided on the nature and incidence of poverty, and levels and trends
in social development over two decades, is being used by the government
to develop a comprehensive programme for poverty elimination. </P>

<P>With UNDP's facilitation and support, District Development Committees
in <B>Nepal </B>are enabling rural people living in poverty to set their
own development agenda. For example, employment generating activities targeted
to women are now linked to the rural credit initiatives of commercial banks,
while local communities ensure that small grants from the Global Environment
Facility protect and regenerate the local environment. </P>

<P>In <B>Mozambique </B>a recently approved pilot project focusing on the
transition from reconstruction to sustainable rural development will be
implemented in nine communities in three provinces. It will assist these
communities in preparing and implementing small-scale projects that respond
to community-identified priorities by promoting village organization and
providing technical and financial assistance to a district Micro-Projects
Fund. This is expected to lead to sustainable income-earning activities.</P>

<H4>Social Summit follow-up</H4>

<P>Poverty was one of the main themes of the World Summit for Social Development
(WSSD) (Copenhagen, March 1995). (The others were the related issues of
employment and social integration.) In cooperation with its development
partners, UNDP contributed to preparations for the Summit by:</P>

<P>• bringing additional depth to the debate on the Summit's three themes
through collaborative research and the funding of publications on employment,
social exclusion, poverty and sustainable livelihoods, human security and
innovative financing mechanisms;</P>

<P>• sponsoring and participating in a variety of fora where poverty and
the other WSSD issues were discussed, including a Mayors' Colloquium and
meetings of the Overseas Development Council, the Business Council and
the UN Development Studies Programme;</P>

<P>• assisting in disseminating information and broadening the participative
involvement of the general public in discussion of WSSD themes through
use of electronic communication networks such as INTERNET;</P>

<P>• supporting national NGO participation in preparations for the Summit;
and </P>

<P>• contributing to governments' efforts to focus concretely on issues
central to the Summit through assistance to their operational programmes
in related areas. </P>

<P>The Summit's Declaration and Programme of Action present a unique opportunity
not only for reinforcing the importance of poverty elimination and social
development within countries' overall development efforts, but for increasing
the effectiveness of the support they receive from the UN development system
in these areas. The Programme of Action calls upon UNDP specifically "to
undertake efforts to support the implementation of social development programmes,
taking into account specific needs of countries in transition." It also
states that UNDP "should organize United Nations system efforts towards
capacity-building at the local, national and regional levels and support
the coordinated implementation of social development programmes through
its network of field offices." </P>

<P>As part of its strategy for implementing the Copenhagen Programme of
Action, UNDP is now helping countries broaden their thinking and operational
approaches to issues of poverty by giving more emphasis to the relationship
between poverty and equity. Recognizing that countries' policies and programmes
must be diverse and cross-sectoral — and that no single UN agency can cover
the corresponding support requirements — UNDP is working to: </P>

<P>• facilitate better coordination among UN development system partners,
among other things, by working closely with them to develop a unified inter-agency
approach to follow-up on the Social Summit and on the other major UN conferences
of the mid-1990s (e.g., on population and development, women and shelter).
UNDP is uniquely qualified for this coordinating role thanks to its broad
development mandate, cooperation with 175 programme countries and territories
and focus on capacity-building. In addition, UNDP Resident Representatives
normally also serve as Resident Coordinators of UN operational assistance
for development in their countries of assignment, and the UN Secretary
General has requested the UNDP Administrator to assist him in improving
overall coordination of UN operational activities for development;</P>

<P>• support specific operational activities across a broad range of issues
affecting poverty. Here, based on its extensive operational experience
and years of collaboration with virtually all of the UN development agencies,
UNDP engages in <B>policy dialogue with governments,</B> and assists them
in developing <B>integrated, multi-sectoral approaches to poverty elimination.</B>
These start with the <B>empowerment of people</B> and <B>the creation of
an enabling environment through sound governance in partnership with civil
society.</B> <BR>
