<H2>APPEAL OF CITIES AGAINST POVERTY</H2>

<P>We, cities of all countries, cities of a world in which poverty still
kills thousands of human beings every day, endangers natural resources
indispensable to life, and compromises the future of all the planet's children,
request:</P>

<UL>
<P>• that our societies make the fight against poverty an absolute priority;
that to do so they mobilize more human resources as well as the additional
national and international financial means needed while assuring the transparency
of their use; </P>

<P>• that they give substance to the commitments made by the heads of state
and government of every continent during the World Summit for Social Development
and to the programme of action adopted by the international community on
that occasion; </P>

<P>• that they take up this challenge together, in an enduring partnership.
</P>
</UL>

<P>It is a matter of human dignity.<BR>
