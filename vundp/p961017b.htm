<P><B><I>Embargoed: Thursday, 17 October at 12:00 noon EDT</I></B></P>

<P><I>New York, <B>17 October 1996</B></I> -- The fight to stop poverty,
which afflicts some 1.3 billion people worldwide, has united mayors from
cities across the USA and Canada. They are seeking to draw widespread public
attention to the harsh effects of social deprivation and to help rally
both local and international support against it. </P>

<P>Mobilized by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the
association Sister Cities International, mayors from 40 cities in North
America have signed proclamations declaring 17 October <B>Poverty Eradication
Day</B> in their municipalities. </P>

<P>Cities joining the drive against poverty include: Akron, Ohio; Albuquerque,
New Mexico; Arlington and Austin, Texas; Charlotte, North Carolina; Cleveland,
Ohio; Colombus, Georgia; Denver, Colorado; Detroit, Michigan; Durham, North
Carolina; Edmonton, Alberta (Canada); Escondido, California; Fort Wayne,
Indiana; Honolulu, Hawaii; Jersey City, New Jersey; Kansas City, Missouri;
Lincoln, Nebraska; Louisville, Kentucky; Miami, Florida; Minneapolis, Minnesota;
Nashville, Tennessee; New Haven, Connecticut; New York, New York; Oklahoma
City, Oklahoma; Omaha, Nebraska; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Raleigh, North
Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; San Francisco, San Jose and Santa Clarita,
California; St. Paul, Minnesota; Spokane, Washington; Stockton, California;
Syracuse, New York; Tampa, Florida; Tempe, Arizona; Tucson, Arizona; Tulsa,
Oklahoma and Washington, DC. </P>

<P>&quot;Poverty does not only affect women and children living in developing
countries; poor (people) live in cities in the most industrialized countries,
including Philadelphia and many other cities here in the United States,&quot;
said Edward G. Rendell, Mayor of Philadelphia. &quot;To become a truly
great global community, we must re-emphasize our commitment to efforts
to eradicate poverty and its devastating impact on human well-being.&quot;</P>

<P>The proclamation signed by Mayor Rendell and others reads in part: &quot;This
occasion is an opportunity for us to rededicate ourselves to make the fight
against poverty an absolute priority, focusing on the needs of the poor
and upon measures that are being undertaken with the collaboration of the
city government and its partners to eradicate poverty....&quot; </P>

<P>In industrialized countries, including the US, more than 100 million
people live in poverty and five million are homeless, according to the
Human Development Report 1996, published by Oxford University Press for
UNDP. And, while the US enjoys steady economic and job growth, the number
of people living below the poverty line is actually growing. That is why
the report states that poverty eradication efforts should not be limited
to poor countries. Poverty extends beyond national borders, just as it
extends beyond the confines of the inner city, the report states. </P>

<P>Reacting to the urgency of the poverty challenge, the United Nations
General Assembly designated 17 October the &quot;International Day for
the Eradication of Poverty&quot; and 1996 the &quot;International Year
for the Eradication of Poverty&quot;. The mobilization of North American
mayors is one of a series of public awareness activities planned by UNDP
for the week of 17 October through 24 October. </P>

<P>Other activities planned include: a UNDP-United Nations Association
contest aimed at encouraging school children across the US to take up poverty
eradication projects in their own communities; and, in what is billed as
a decisive gesture of solidarity for the world's poor, UNDP has invited
staff of all UN agencies to fast on 18 October and to donate $5 each to
development projects. Additional information on UNDP's poverty eradication
activities may be found on UNDP's home page on the World Wide Web (http://www.undp.org).</P>

<P>&quot;Unless we address the problems of poverty now, none of the great
goals the international community has set -- peace, stability, human rights
for all, preservation of the environment -- are achievable in a world where
half of the people find themselves shut out of opportunity and the benefits
of a global society,&quot; said UNDP Administrator James Gustave Speth.</P>
