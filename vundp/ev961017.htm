<H2>COMMEMORATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR THE ERADICATION OF POVERTY<BR>
OCTOBER 17-24</H2>

<P>In rich countries such as the U.S., more than 100 million people live
in poverty and 5 million are homeless. While rich people in the U.S. are
getting richer, the number of people living below the poverty line is actually
increasing. And, the U.S. is first in AIDS cases, ranks 18th in life expectancy
and is first in annual environmental degradation among rich countries.
</P>

<P>The figures are even more troubling on a global level. Today, 1.3 billion
people or one-third of the world's population lives in poverty. Each year,
25 million more people fall into the depths of this social scourge. More
than a third of the world's children is malnourished. </P>

<P>Given the urgency and magnitude of the poverty challenge, the United
Nations General Assembly declared 1996 the International Year for the Eradication
of Poverty. </P>

<P>October 17, the International day for the Eradication of Poverty, provides
a unique opportunity to reflect on the stark reality that is poverty --
lack of sufficient food, safe water, reliable health care adequate shelter
education, training and income-earning. The events planned by UNDP on that
date and the activities which will continue through October 24 (United
Nations Day), serve as a vivid call to action and civic responsibility.</P>

<P>Through these events, UNDP makes a public plea to all citizens to begin
to demonstrate active solidarity for the masses of poor people around the
world. For, according to the <I>Human Development Report</I>, poverty affects
all countries, not merely the poorest of the world's nations. It extends
beyond the confines of inner cities just as it surpasses national borders.
And the consequences of poverty -- drugs, forced migration, environmental
degradation, diseases such as AIDS and terrorism travel without a passport
and stop at no frontier. </P>

<P>The attached schedule of events will provide you with details on what
is being planned. We look forward to seeing you. </P>
