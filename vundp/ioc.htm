<H2>COOPERATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE AND
THE UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME</H2>

<P>In March 1996, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) agreed to observe the International
Year for the Eradication of Poverty (1996) by pooling their respective
world networks and capabilities in a decade-long effort to promote anti-poverty
activities and public awareness campaigns. A joint working group established
by the two organizations is developing a programme of cooperation, focusing
on community-level action.</P>

<P>UNDP country offices and National Olympic Committees worldwide will
cooperate in developing and carrying out local poverty-eradication activities.
They will also work to ensure that even the poorest of the poor have access
to sports. In addition, UNDP and the IOC are jointly designing events to
create global awareness of the nature and dimensions of poverty, worldwide.</P>

<P>In signing the accord, UNDP Administrator, James Gustave Speth, said
that it comes at a time when poverty has become the greatest challenge
facing the planet, endangering the future of all our children and of coming
generations. "Drastic measures must be taken both at national and international
levels if we are to avoid carrying this deprivation well into the next
century," he said.</P>

<P>Mr. Speth noted that US$40 billion a year is needed to meet basic human
development needs, and that much more is needed to defeat poverty completely.
While UNDP has advanced creative proposals which show that, through appropriate
action, the bill can be paid, he said that the fight to end poverty doesn't
stop there but is also a matter of individual civic responsibility. "This
is why UNDP and the IOC are developing a joint programme of action to stimulate
grass roots initiatives throughout the world, as well as to inform the
public at large about the nature and dimensions of the problem and its
solutions," he said.</P>

<P>Mr. Samaranch, President of the IOC said that the goal of Olympism is
to place sport at the service of the harmonious development of man everywhere,
so as to encourage the establishment of a peaceful society concerned with
the preservation of human dignity. "Through the Olympic Solidarity fund,
the IOC is also conducting development projects around the world," he said.
"Our symbolic cooperation with UNDP is part of this notion of Olympic Solidarity".</P>

<P>The UNDP-IOC accord marks UNDP's second cooperation initiative with
the sports world. Under a highly publicized campaign that began in 1995,
"A Goal: Human Development", members of national football teams worldwide
signed an appeal to mobilize against poverty and to promote human development.
A display of soccer balls they autographed in connection with that commitment
has attracted many visitors and generated extensive media coverage, at
the UN, and on a tour of European cities. </P>
