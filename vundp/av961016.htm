<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="500"><FONT SIZE=+1>Achievements In Poverty
Eradication </FONT>More than one-fifth of the world's people live in extreme
poverty, on little more than US$1.00 a day. UNDP sees poverty as a complex
and multi-dimensional phenomenon, involving people's lack of empowerment,
as well as their lack of income and basic services. 
<P>UNDP supports programmes that assist gov-ernments and organizations
of civil society in developing economic and social policies and programmes
to address the whole range of factors that contribute to poverty. Among
other things, these programmes seek to increase food security; improve
the availability and quality of shelter and basic services; generate opportunities
for employment and sustainable livelihoods; empower women and men through
access to assets and productive resources such as land, credit, technology,
training and markets; and enable people to participate in the political
forces that shape their lives. Here are some examples.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>CHINA: TARGETING 80 MILLION</FONT> China's &quot;8-7&quot;
programme aims to raise the living standards of the 80 million Chinese
citizens who still live below the poverty line, in seven years. This programme
includes a poverty eradication initiative targeting six poor counties in
southwestern China, supported by UNDP and several UN agencies. It emphasizes
income generation, health and education, and features a participatory approach.
UNDP is supporting the work of the China Community Corps in identifying
poor households and organizing members into self-help groups. The World
Food Programme (WFP) is contributing food aid to support terracing and
other sustainable agricultural practices. UNICEF provides maternal/child
health care and primary education. The International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD) provides for rural credit. (Duration: 1994-2001; Partners:
China, WFP, UNICEF, IFAD)</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>SUDAN: AREA DEVELOPMENT SCHEMES</FONT> Area Development
Schemes in five drought-prone rural areas of Sudan take a participatory
approach to eradicating poverty in an environmentally sustainable way.
Developed in collaboration with several UN agencies, the schemes have benefitted
half a million people in 2,000 of the country+s poorest villages. Participants
have been mobilized, organised and trained to select, implement and manage
activities through Village Development Committees, over 30 per cent of
whose members are women. Credit comes from revolving funds jointly financed
by the communities and UNDP. Fields covered include agriculture, afforestation,
water supply, handicrafts, small-scale industry, and other income generating
pursuits. The approach will be replicated in other countries. (Duration:
1990-1996; Partners: Sudan, with technical assistance from United Nations
Office for Project Services, Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN,
International Labour Organisation and United Nations Department for Development
Support and Management Services. Related social services provided by UNICEF
(in one province) and food-for-work by World Food Programme) </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>ETHIOPIA: SOCIAL REHABILITATION FUND</FONT> Ethiopia emerged
from nearly 30 years of civil strife with thousands of communities in need
of rehabilitation, thousands of returning refugees and some 400,000 demobilized
soldiers. The Ethiopian Social Rehabilitation and Development Fund began
to test a self-help, community-based approach to rehabilitation and development
in 1992. In the initial phase, 1,220,000 people benefitted from more than
200 projects: clinics, schools, drainage facilities, communal latrines,
small dams and income generating enterprises like grinding mills, quarries
and electrical workshops. Community organizations, local government staffs
and NGOs simultaneously improved project planning and implementation capacities.
The Fund is being expanded to implement small-scale, community-based projects
throughout rural Ethiopia. UNDP is helping to mobilize the US$243 million
required for this phase, and to put together machinery to effectively manage
these resources. (Duration: Pilot phase: 1992-95; Current phase: 1995-97;
Partners: Ethiopia, World Bank, Canada, Italy, Norway, Sweden)</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>EL SALVADOR: SUPPORTING SMALL FARMERS</FONT> Some 7,000
farmers in the Caba&ucirc;os and San Vicente departments of El Salvador
have benefitted from UNDP support to the Project Execution Unit of the
Ministry of Agriculture. Of these, more than 2,000 small agricultural producers
have received credits totalling US$1.1 million. Approximately 2,500 Project
Execution Unit technicians and small producers have been trained in sustainable
agricultural techniques, entrepreneurial development and credit management.
Twenty-six demonstration farms have been established to carry out research
and extension activities. Six pilot commercial groups have been established,
resulting in the farmers paying lower prices for seeds and fertilizer,
and receiving high prices for their produce. Many farmers have diversified
their production from basic crops and are now producing vegetables and
fruit. (Duration: 1993-99; Partners: Ecuador, Central American Bank for
Economic Integration)<BR>
