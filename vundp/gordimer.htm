<P>I like the bold concept of a year dedicated to the eradication of poverty,
the refusal to throw up hands, internationally, and accept that a certain
level of poverty has been part of the human condition since Adam and Eve
were cast out of Paradise, and will be with us forever. </P>

<P>Others better qualified than I will point out how the untapped and/or
wasted resources of the world, in its soil and in its seas, could indeed
eradicate what the term &quot;poverty&quot; means as it is immediately
conceived: lack of food. Feed the world, and that will be the end of poverty.
And, of course, no one could argue that sustenance itself is not the priority.
And that, further, with the wars that plague us, in the case of the communities
of the oppressed and the communities of the aggressors, ordinary people
are starving victims alike, and must be succoured without moral discrimination.
To quote Bertolt Brecht in my own rough translation: &quot;First fill the
belly, then talk right and wrong.&quot;</P>

<P>But poverty has aspects other than lack of bread or rice or maize meal
-- basics that keep the body alive.</P>

<P>In my own country, South Africa, lack of clean water has become one
of the definitions of poverty, existing in communities that nevertheless
have enough to eat.</P>

<P>The apartheid regime callously accepted that this kind of poverty, among
others, was the lot of black communities; a trickle in a polluted river
bed serving as both drinking water and for washing clothes and flesh was
the reticulation available to them. An academic named Kader Asmal came
back from political exile and as Minister of Water Affairs in our government
led by the African National Congress defined this aspect of poverty. In
two years he has established installations that pipe clean water to thousands
of people who never before had access to it.</P>

<P>Food and water; they go together in eliminating the material aspects
of poverty, along with shelter. For a long period, for many people in the
more prosperous parts of the modern world, homelessness was something that
existed elsewhere. It was truly a Third World phenomenon. The few <I>clochards
</I>in Paris, picturesque rather than a matter for social conscience, the
panhandlers as part of the tough bums-and-millionaires character of New
York--at home, theirs was token destitution that could be bought off with
a handful of small change. But now the Third World of poverty rather than
geographical definition is everywhere; every city in the world is a warren
of people with nowhere to live. Plastic and cardboard shelters are the
defining architectural style of the late 20th century. Feed the world,
and that will not be the end of poverty while men, women and their children
squat in mud and dust, sun and rain.</P>

<P>Even beyond these material manifestations is another poverty. I want
to speak of the deprivation of the intellect, of the world of ideas, from
which millions suffer often without knowing it, condemned to plod through
their lives at the lowest level of human consciousness. This goes beyond
mere ignorance, though it begins with the fact of vast-spread illiteracy;
many who can read and write can do so only listlessly in respect of the
most humdrum demands of daily life. </P>

<P>The exploration of the truly human fullness of existence and of the
ever-expanding limits of our consciousness with conceptual tools that rouse
curiosity, wonderment at why we are here on earth, what influences and
forms our attitudes to one another, to other creatures, to that layer of
being, our environment, which encases us -- the mind that has no access
to these, no access to music beyond pop jingles, literature beyond the
bubble text of comics, beauty of form beyond the poses of cover girls,
is in a state of poverty. First feed the belly, then talk aesthetics? Yes.
But let us understand poverty as the sum of all its hungers, the conscious
and the unconscious ones of its victims. Our responsibility is all-encompassing,
this and every year.</P>
