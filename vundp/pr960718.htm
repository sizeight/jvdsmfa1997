<H2>OLYMPIC ATHLETES UNITE AGAINST POVERTY; APPEAL LAUNCHED IN ATLANTA
BY INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE AND UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME</H2>

<P><I>New York, <B>18 July 1996</B></I> -- Hundreds of athletes have signed
a huge billboard at Atlanta's Olympic Village as part of the appeal against
poverty that has been launched by the International Olympic Committee (IOC)
and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The appeal and the
billboard signing demonstrate the athletes' strong commitment to help mobilize
the international community against the scourge of poverty, which grips
much of the world today. Currently, one in five people in the world lives
in absolute poverty, 900 million adults cannot read or write and 1.3 billion
people do not have access to safe water. Pledging to join the battle against
poverty reflects the Olympic ideals of human dignity and well-being. </P>

<P>The United Nations General Assembly proclaimed 1997-2006 as the international
decade for the eradication of poverty, following the International Year
for the Eradication of Poverty (IYEP), 1996. </P>

<P>The IOC and UNDP are pooling their respective networks and capabilities
to undertake grassroots anti-poverty initiatives and information campaigns
on poverty around the world. The collaboration between the two institutions
includes promoting greater access by poor people to sports and physical
education.</P>

<P>In March, the IOC Athletes Commission pledged its full support to IOC
humanitarian activities in general, and within the framework of the IYEP
as proclaimed by the UN General Assembly in particular. It also called
upon the athletes of the world &quot;to actively participate in human development
projects with the UN system and non-governmental organizations&quot;, as
well as to be involved in promoting the well-being of society, including
socially constructive initiatives and assisting the medically disadvantaged.
</P>

<P>In line with this goal, the Appeal of the Olympic Athletes against Poverty
launched in Atlanta starts with a commitment. Athletes who sign up pledge
to help eradicate poverty, promote solidarity and human development. They
also seek to rally public opinion, and call for national and international
tangible action as they request that our societies make the fight against
poverty an absolute priority. </P>

<P>&quot;This accord comes at a time when poverty has become the greatest
challenge facing the planet,&quot; said the Administrator of UNDP, James
Gustave Speth. &quot;Poverty on such a wide scale endangers the future
of all our children and of coming generations. Drastic measures must be
taken both at national and international levels if we are to avoid carrying
this deprivation well into the next century. Forty billion dollars a year
are needed to meet basic human development needs. Much more is needed to
defeat poverty completely.&quot; Mr. Speth added that the fight to end
poverty is also a matter of individual civic responsibility. This is why
UNDP and the IOC are developing a joint programme of action to stimulate
grassroots initiatives throughout the world, as well as to inform the public
about the nature of the problem and its solutions.</P>

<P>It is expected that after the Olympic Games athletes will hand over
the Appeal to the government authorities of their respective countries.
&quot;The goal of Olympism is to place everywhere sport at the service
of the harmonious development of man, with a view to encouraging the establishment
of a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity,&quot;
stressed Juan Antonio Samaranch, President of the IOC, on the occasion
of the signing of the IOC-UNDP cooperation agreement earlier this year.
Mr. Samaranch also said that this cooperation &quot;is part of the notion
of Olympic Solidarity&quot;, noting that through the Olympic Solidarity
fund, the IOC is also conducting development projects throughout the world.
</P>

<P>In addition to the Appeal being launched at the Olympic Village during
the XXVIth Games, field activities undertaken jointly by National Olympic
Committees and local UNDP offices are beginning to get underway in developing
countries throughout the world, including in Botswana, Colombia, Georgia
and Malaysia. </P>
