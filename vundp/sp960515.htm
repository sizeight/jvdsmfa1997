<H2>Putting Mass Poverty Behind Us: An Imperative for United Nations Cooperation<BR>
</H2>

<P><I>United Nations, Geneva, <B>15 May 1996</B></I></P>

<P><B>Press Conference </B></P>

<P><B>Mr. James Gustave Speth</B></P>

<P>Despite all efforts, poverty today is growing faster than population,
or, at least not slower, and populations are growing in unprecedented numbers.
One and a half billion people live in poverty in United Nations programme
countries. The conditions of life of twice that number are deplorable.
Half the people in sub-Sahara Africa will be living in absolute poverty
by the year 2000.</P>

<P>Poverty is also relative, and here the figures are equally shocking.
Between 1960 and 1990, the gap between the world's richest 20 per cent
and the poorest 20 per cent did not decrease; it doubled — from 30 fold
to 60 fold. Even with all the growth in Asia, the percentage of world income
of the OECD countries actually increased, from 68 per cent to 72 per cent.
</P>

<P>Without sustained progress to a fairer, more equitable world, growing
poverty and joblessness, population pressures, environmental decay, and
the widening gap between the haves and the have-nots will breed despair
and instability. It is from this cauldron of injustice, frustration and
hopelessness that conflict and violence boil over.</P>

<P>Any attack on mass poverty must include real economic growth, and the
fundamental policies needed to assure it. But it is a myth that this growth
is being widely achieved. The World Bank recently reported that over half
of United Nations programme countries had negative real per capita income
growth over the last decade. The 48 least developed countries (LDCs) are
worst off. With 10 per cent of the world's population, they have 0.1 per
cent of the world's income. For 25 years, their per capita incomes, on
average, have declined. Today, it stands at about US$350.</P>

<P>It is also a myth that the forces of the private market in an increasingly
globalized economy will suffice to replace the need for development cooperation.
If countries would just adopt trade and investment-friendly policies, and
make other structural adjustments, they could hitch their wagons to the
global economy and enjoy the ride to greater prosperity — or so the myth
has it.</P>

<P>But we know that these approaches are no answer for much of the developing
world. There is no correlation between need and direct foreign investment.
Almost all direct foreign investment goes to 20 countries; just 6 per cent
to Africa, and 2 per cent to the LDCs.</P>

<P>Moreover, even where we have the right macro framework and fundamentals
in place, with growing privatization, liberalization and deregulation,
the result is often growth, but growth with increasing poverty, increasing
inequity, increasing unemployment. Too much emphasis on macro policy alone
has led to lopsided, unbalanced and environmentally unsustainable growth.</P>

<P>So, any credible attack on world poverty must include a large increase
in development cooperation — and some increase in development assistance
— at its core. Our world today needs more development assistance, not less,
whatever the trend might be. But the need is for radically reformed development
cooperation:</P>

<P>&middot; cooperation which recognizes that economies exist for people,
not people for economies;</P>

<P>&middot; cooperation that benefits the poor more than the rich;</P>

<P>&middot; cooperation not just with governments but with the private
sector and civil society;</P>

<P>&middot; cooperation that recognizes that the polity is as important
as the economy;</P>

<P>&middot; cooperation that seeks growth, yes, but growth with equity,
empowerment, employment and environment;</P>

<P>&middot; cooperation that no longer gives more to high military spenders
than to low military spenders;</P>

<P>&middot; cooperation, in effect, for sustainable human development.</P>

<P>We at the United Nations — under the Secretary-General's leadership
— have concluded that the attack on poverty should have five principal
thrusts — five thrusts that come directly from the continuum of the United
Nations conferences which began at Rio, continued most recently at Beijing,
and will conclude with Habitat II and the World Food Summit this year.</P>

<P>The good news is that, for the first time, we have the entire United
Nations system, including the Bretton Woods institutions, organized around
these five thrusts:</P>

<P>First basic social services for all — investing in people — led by UNFPA
and including UNICEF, WHO, UNESCO and others;</P>

<P>Second jobs and sustainable livelihoods for all, led by ILO and including
UNDP, UNIDO, and others. Food security is included here, and so are the
UN's three Rome-based agricultural agencies;</P>

<P>Third sustaining the natural resource base, on which the poor depend.
Here, the machinery put in place to follow-up on the 1992 Rio Earth Summit
continues;</P>

<P>Fourth advancement and empowerment of women, led by the Secretary-General's
special representative on gender issues, with support from UNIFEM and others;
and</P>

<P>Fifth the overarching &quot;enabling environment&quot;, led by the World
Bank and including UNCTAD, IMF, UNDP and others.</P>

<P>Among other tasks, the enabling environment group is focusing on good
governance. The UNDP role in this area has increased. One-third of UNDP
resources are now being spent on capacity development for good governance.</P>

<P>The enabling environment is extraordinarily important. We must make
trade work for the poor, not against them; we must make direct foreign
investment correlate with need; the burdens of structural adjustment must
be made to fall more on the rich than on the poor; and growth must be equitably
and fairly distributed.</P>

<P>In all five areas, United Nations Headquarters groups are working to
support United Nations country teams. At the country level, Resident Coordinators
are organizing United Nations teams around these themes.</P>

<P>The Group of 77 has offered to work with us on this follow-up to United
Nations conferences, and we accept. The OECD/DAC has also supported this
approach.</P>

<P>UNDP has been given responsibility for integrating all this into concerted
support for country-led, country-owned, country-devised anti-poverty plans
of action.</P>

<P>In this era of cries for United Nations reform, this is a major United
Nations reform.</P>

<P>None of this will be possible without a revitalized commitment to an
enlarged but reformed development cooperation.</P>

<P>Is it not ironic that:</P>

<P>&middot; just when the cold war is over and we are freed at last from
its distorting effects on development assistance;</P>

<P>&middot; just when we know so much more about what works and what does
not work in development cooperation; and</P>

<P>&middot; just when the needs of the developing world for assistance
are growing;</P>

<P>that right at this crucial juncture, support for cooperation is declining?</P>

<P>And it is not ironic that:</P>

<P>&middot; just when we have greater understanding of the powerful link
between peace and development, seen by all in the Middle East and Bosnia;</P>

<P>&middot; just when the United Nations is called upon to assume even
greater responsibilities, including the follow-up to UN conferences and
post-conflict peace-building; and</P>

<P>&middot; just when the United Nations is reforming itself to do these
things;</P>

<P>that right at this crucial juncture, financial resources available to
the UN to do these things are declining?</P>

<P>Yes, there are ironies; but they are more, they are tragedies. Let us
not doubt it.</P>

<P>Let it not be said of our time that we, who had the power to do better,
allowed the world to become further divided. We need cohesive globalization,
not fractured globalization. Together, let us build a new World Wide Web
— a World Wide Web of equity, hope and opportunity. <BR>
