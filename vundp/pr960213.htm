<H2>URBAN FARMING HELPS COMBAT POVERTY, MALNUTRITION</H2>

<P><B>One-Seventh of World's Food Produced in Garbage Dumps, Vacant Lots,

<P><B>800 Million Urban Farmers Worldwide</B></P>

<P><I>NEW YORK, <B>13 February 1996</B></I> -- Urban farming is helping
lift hundreds of millions of people out of extreme poverty and is improving
health and nutrition of city-dwellers across the globe, states a report
published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) today.</P>

<P>Urban agriculture is practiced by an estimated 800 million people, shows
the report, Urban Agriculture: Food, Jobs and Sustainable Cities. It takes
place in all regions of the world--in developing and developed countries
alike--but is most prevalent in Asia.</P>

<P>Urban agriculture ranges from growing crops on rooftops to raising livestock
in backyards and raising fish in ponds, streams and lagoons.</P>

<P>For the poorest of the poor, urban agriculture provides access to food
and helps stamp out malnutrition, says the report. For the &quot;stable
poor,&quot; it provides a source of income and high-quality food at a low
cost. And for middle-income families, it offers the possibility of savings
and a return on investment in urban property.</P>

<P>According to the report, the world's poorest urban households spend
as much as 90 percent of their income on food. For these people, urban
agriculture offers an opportunity for a better diet and a chance to shift
household spending toward other needs, such as health care and housing.
In Sao Paulo, Brazil, urban households--rich and poor--devote about 50
percent of their income to food. The situation is worse in Istanbul, Turkey,
where 60 percent goes to food. In Lima, Peru, the number climbs to 70 percent,
and in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam, the number is as high as 80 percent.</P>

<P>Urban agriculture, which is on the rise everywhere as the populations
of the world's cities swell, is also helping create jobs. In Calcutta,
India, for example, about 20,000 people have found jobs farming on the
city's garbage dumps.</P>

<P>&quot;Urban farming provides scarce jobs to many in the city,&quot;
the report says. &quot;In some cities, as many as one-fifth to two-thirds
of all families are engaged in agriculture, with as many as a third of
these having no other source of income.&quot; </P>

<P>&quot;Urban farming is a competitive economic activity and the industry
of choice of millions of urban entrepreneurs,&quot; the study says. &quot;It
also provides income-generating opportunities for people with low skills
and little capital, as well as people with limited mobility, including
women, children and aged persons.&quot;</P>

<P>But benefits of urban agriculture extend beyond better nutrition, poverty
reduction and jobs for the poor. Environmental benefits are equally significant,
the report notes.</P>

<P>&quot;Urban agriculture turns waste from a problem into a resource,
reduces the public cost of waste management...and provides a better living
environment.&quot; In Khartoum, for example, about one-fourth of the city's
garbage is consumed by farm animals. In Calcutta, sewage feeds 3,000 hectares
of lagoons, which produce 6,000 tons of fish each year. And in the State
of California, 200 wastewater reclamation plants save nearly 800,000 cubic
meters of water a day, with most of the treated effluent put to agricultural
use.</P>

<P>The news is not all good, however. Urban agriculture does have a downside,
the report warns. When untreated human waste is used as fertilizer, consumers
risk contracting diseases like cholera and hepatitis. And indiscriminate
use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers can contaminate local water
supplies.</P>

<P>Too often, governments have confronted these problems by attempting
to ban urban agriculture, denying cities an important source of food and
economic growth. A better solution is to devise policies that encourage
urban farmers to keep producing food yet protect people from key health
hazards, the report argues.</P>

<P>Because governments have often failed to nurture urban agriculture or
to understand how it works, its economic potential remains largely untapped.
&quot;It has become clear that urban agriculture has been underrated in
all but a handful of countries--and mostly overlooked by the international
development community,&quot; writes UNDP Assistant Administrator Anders
Wijkman in the foreword of the report. But by putting simple laws into
effect, urban agriculture's potential can be unleashed and the sector can
become a formidable economic force in the 21st century.</P>

<P>The report is based on three years of research funded mostly by UNDP
and carried out mainly by the Urban Agriculture Network, a Washington-based
non-governmental organization.</P>

<P>The report is the first in a series of publications to be released by
UNDP in 1996 to guide the debate at the United Nations-sponsored HABITAT-II
conference to take place in Istanbul in June.</P>
