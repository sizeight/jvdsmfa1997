<H2>THREE WHO ARE BEATING THE POVERTY CLOCK</H2>

<H3>Winning the fight against poverty with help from friends</H3>

<P>The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) invited these three
people, whose lives have changed (and who in turn are changing the lives
of others), to share their experiences at an event held at UN Headquarters
in New York to inaugurate the International Year for the Eradication of
Poverty.</P>

<P>Following are their brief biographies and descriptions of the projects
in which they are involved. Betty Bangira is a Zimbabwean mother of four
whose life was changed when her community joined with five others to create
an irrigation project in one of the country's desertified provinces. She
has been elected spokesperson of her cooperative for her commitment to
self-help against poverty.</P>

<P>Luis Ticona Mamani is an indigenous Aymara of the Bolivian highlands
who is now the Director of an association of alpaca herdsmen. The association
has improved both the quality and exports of alpaca fibre and has tripled
incomes of some 4,000 families in Bolivia's barren altiplano. </P>

<P>Lenore Cola is a mother of three, a resident of the Harlem section of
New York, USA. Ms. Cola, whose family was homeless for four years, became
involved in 1989 in a street library programme for children and their parents
organized by International Movement ATD Fourth World, and has since become
a leader in the programme and in her community. </P>

<H3><B>Betty Bangira</B></H3>

<P>Betty Bangira is married with four children and lives in the Mhondoro
Communal Area in Bangira Village about 80 kilometres south of Harare in
Mashonaland West Province, Zimbabwe. Her husband, who suffers from a kidney
ailment, has been unemployed for more than five years. Ms. Bangira is 27
years old and has two years of secondary school education. She lives in
a hut and works one half of a hectare of vegetables. The nearest borehole
for safe drinking water is five kilometres away. Her livestock consists
of two chickens. Ms. Bangira is a member of the Kushinga Cooperative.</P>

<P>As in many Communal Areas in Zimbabwe, the Mhondoro Communal Area suffers
from encroaching desertification. A group of people from six villages approached
the United Nations Development Programme's &quot;Africa 2000&quot; programme
in 1993 for help in irrigating the low-quality, dry land of the area. A
dam was built by 1995 which provided necessary irrigation. Ms. Bangira
joined the cooperative in 1995. Although it was a bad drought year, she
was able to grow and harvest vegetables, and with the proceeds buy mealie
meal, two pots and a sugar bowl. Next harvest she wants to buy a pan. Her
colleagues selected her to be their ambassador of goodwill for her thrift,
her work with others and her commitment to self-help against poverty. </P>

<H3>Mhondoro Communal Area Irrigation Project,<BR>
Zimbabwe</H3>

<P>This project combines poverty alleviation, natural resource management,
food production and biodiversity. </P>

<P><B><I>Background</I></B></P>

<P>The Mhondoro Communal Area of Zimbabwe suffers from encroaching desertification
resulting from widespread soil erosion due in turn to deforestation, uncontrolled
cultivation and overgrazing. Land degradation and gullies are common. Rivers
in the area are silted, and the occurrence of drought, even on a small
scale, results in severe livestock losses and food shortages. </P>

<P><B><I>The project</I></B></P>

<P>Six villages in the Mashonaland West Province of Zimbabwe organized
themselves into the Kushinga Cooperative in October 1993 and approached
the Africa 2000 Network of the United Nations Development Programme. Africa
2000 supports income-generating and environmentally sound small projects
in rural Africa, designed and put in place by the people who benefit from
them. Grants are typically less than US$5,000. Half of the national coordinators
are women. The Kushinga Cooperative wanted funding of a water catchment
basin for irrigation. The objectives: improved range lands for increased
productivity of livestock; better management of arable lands to reduce
soil erosion and enhance crop yields; increased water supply to permit
introduction of additional plant species in the environment; increased
tree planting, and a community more responsible for its own development
and environmental management. </P>

<P>A small dam was constructed between May of 1994 and June of 1995 with
the assistance of agricultural engineering and environmental technical
services of the government. The capacity of the dam is 30,400 cubic metres,
or 6.7 million gallons. The community contribution in labor, tree planting
and reclamation of gullies is estimated at $4,120. The resulting projects
include a grazing scheme and nutrition garden, managed by the Cooperative.
</P>

<P>The outside funding for the project, $50,000, was committed by UNDP/Africa
2000 and the Small Grants programme of the Global Environment Facility
(GEF). GEF is a joint funding and technical assistance organization for
environmentally sustainable development managed by UNDP, the World Bank
and the United Nations Environment Programme. </P>

<H3>Luis Ticona Mamani</H3>

<P>Luis Ticona was born into an indigenous Aymara family and community
on the altiplano of Bolivia in 1946. He has devoted all his working life
to improving the economic condition of the impoverished rural families
of the Bolivian highlands. </P>

<P>Mr. Ticona was trained in community development, cooperative enterprise
management and accounting. He began his career in 1969 with the National
Community Development Service, where he worked for five years in remote
rural areas. His successes there led to his appointment as national coordinator
of programs for rural youth.</P>

<P>In 1979, moved by the plight of impoverished alpaca producers of the
altiplano, Mr. Ticona and several of his community development colleagues
developed a project to improve the economic situation of the families whose
only source of income is the raising of the alpaca (a &quot;camelid,&quot;
related to the llama) and the sale of the alpaca wool fibre. Mr. Ticona's
work led to the establishment of the Integrated Association of Camelid
Producers of the High Andes. Mr. Ticona has been the manager of the association
nearly continuously since its founding, testimony to the high regard in
which he is held by the more than 1,000 member families who have benefited
from his stewardship of the association and its assets. He was recently
elected president of the new National Network of Camelid Producers and
was appointed to the National Livestock Policy Committee of the Bolivian
Secretariat of Agriculture. </P>

<H3>Bolivia Alpaca Fibre Production and <BR>
Processing Project</H3>

<P>The Bolivia Alpaca Project, begun in 1992, was designed to alleviate
the extreme poverty of approximately 4,000 alpaca producing families of
the Bolivian Altiplano. Because of harsh conditions and high altitude these
families depend on their alpacas (members of the same &quot;camelid&quot;
family as llamas) as their only source of income. Prior to the project,
family income averaged US$300 a year. Now it averages $900 a year. Before
the project, poor quality alpaca wool fibre was bought by middlemen from
neighbouring countries and smuggled out of Bolivia. Today, thanks to a
$1.3 million processing plant opened in November of 1994 and 80 per cent
owned by small alpaca producers, quality alpaca fibre is exported to Italian
and other European spinning plants, as well as being used in the domestic
knitted apparel industry.</P>

<P>Other results of the project:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Loans to 441 producer families with an on-time repayment rate of 98
per cent over the past four years. </LI>

<LI>The establishment of preventive and curative animal health programmes
which have resulted in a 30 per cent reduction in adult alpaca mortality
and 35 per cent reduction in infant alpaca deaths. The introduction of
more than 7,000 high-quality breeding animals to improve the yields of
500 herds. </LI>

<LI>The development of 7,200 hectares of improved pastures and the irrigation
and reclamation of 3,100 hectares of desertified land. </LI>
</UL>

<P>These results were attained through a field technical assistance programme
carried out with the Association of Camelid Producers of the High Andes
through hands-on extension services on farms, and a revolving loan fund.
Technical assistance was provided in animal health, pasture improvement,
genetic improvement, herd management and the introduction of modern shearing
and fibre handling processes. </P>

<P>The processing plant is now producing 100 tons of alpaca wool a year,
valued at $1.3 million annually on the European market. Firm orders from
European textile companies have meant that producers are selling the fibre
at $5 a kilogram to the plant, compared to $1.60 when sold to intermediaries
in earlier years. The plant in turn adds value of $8 to $10 per kilogram,
resulting in an export price of $13 to $15 a kilogram, some nine times
the earlier top price received. Because the small producers hold 80 per
cent stock ownership of the plant, either directly or through the association,
the income from the plant can help make the entire industry self-sustaining.
Proceeds from the plant will fund the veterinary and technical assistance
activities begun under the project. </P>

<P>Funding for the project came from the producers association ($240,000),
the United Nations Capital Development Fund ($3,135,623) the United Nations
Development Programme ($683,288) and the organization Appropriate Technology
International, or ATI ($442,625). ATI was the implementing organization
in the project.</P>

<H3>Lenore Cola </H3>

<P>Ms. Lenore Cola was born in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1952. She was
raised in New York City. She is currently living in Harlem with her three
children.</P>

<P>Ms. Cola is a high-school graduate. She completed a year of nursing
school, but was unable to finish the programme in which she was enroled.</P>

<P>She worked as a nursing assistant for seven years in Louisiana, then
moved back to New York City. Unable to find a job, she became homeless.
She and her family lived in different shelters for four years.</P>

<P>Ms. Cola became involved with the Fourth World Movement in 1989, while
she was living in one of the shelters in Harlem. She and her children participated
actively in the street library program run by Fourth World Movement volunteers
in the area.</P>

<P>After having been rehoused, Ms. Cola became involved with the Fourth
World Family Network. This training program brings together parents from
poor and non poor backgrounds. One of its objectives is to encourage parents
to support and prolong the activities of the street libraries. Another
objective is to make known the lives, hopes and experiences of poor families.
Parents thus learn together how to represent their own community. Members
of the network have met with local officials and have participated in national
and international meetings. Ms. Cola, in particular, has also helped new
families become involved in this programme. In addition, she is active
in her community, including within her children's school.</P>

<P>In October 1994, Ms. Cola was a delegate to the Second International
Fourth World Family Congress, which took place in New York and in Washington,
DC. Within the context of the congress, she participated in a seminar entitled,
&quot;Extreme Poverty and the Denial of Human Rights,&quot; organized by
the United Nations Center for Human Rights. There, she actively took part
in discussions with United Nations officials, scholars and other delegates
to the congress from around the world. </P>

<H3>The Street Library Programme</H3>

<P>In a report to the French Economic and Social Council about extreme
poverty and the insecurities to which it exposes people, the founder of
the International Movement ATD Fourth World, Father Joseph Wresinski, wrote:
&quot;Many of the difficulties children encounter in school are rooted
in their social, economic and, above all, cultural deprivation. One of
the highest prorities in the fight against poverty is to improve access
to basic education and skills training for the most disadvantaged children.&quot;
The street library programme that is carried out with impoverished families
in different parts of the world, developed as a way to foster an interest
in learning through books, art and computers.</P>

<P>The local programme presently reaches about 120 children between the
ages of 5 and 12, and their parents, in East New York, Brooklyn. In the
past, it has been present in central Harlem, Coney Island, the South Bronx
and in several shelters for homeless families. Volunteers of the International
Movement ATD Fourth World and friends of the organization go to each site
once a week after school with a bookcase on wheels and other material.
Children come to read, to listen to stories and to participate in other
activities that encourage them to learn. One long-term project last year
involved constructing with the children a rollercoaster for marbles, inspired
by a sculpture in the Port Authority. The workshop included designing the
model on computer, and building it with a variety of tools and materials.
</P>

<P>While keeping the focus on books, the programme introduces arts, crafts
and computers. By discovering the joy of reading and learning in general,
the children gain confidence in themselves. One child stated, &quot;I like
to read, it makes my brain good!&quot;</P>

<P>The street library programme takes place where the children live, so
their parents can play a role as active partners. These parents are confronted
daily with the struggle to bring up their families in very difficult conditions.
Because volunteers of ATD Fourth World want to learn from the parents what
they already do to encourage their children to move ahead, they visit the
parents and ask them to help plan and evaluate the activities of the street
library. The project brings parents together and supports them in their
desire to contribute to the improvement of their neighbourhoods. For example,
some parents have been especially helpful in trying to get other, more
excluded families to participate in the activities. One mother stated,
&quot;The volunteers help us organize. We try to get more parents and more
kids involved. But it is kind of hard, because some parents don't want
to come. They feel ashamed. They are afraid that somebody might look down
on them. But in the street libraries it's not like that.&quot;</P>

<P>The International Movement ATD Fourth World tries to extend this partnership
to include local government agencies and other members of the private sector
that share the same concerns. For example, the street library programme
has played a role in the city's struggle against the presence of drugs
in its neighborhoods. The State of New York recognized this impact by presenting
the organization with a grant from the Office of Alchoholism and Substance
Abuse Services.</P>
