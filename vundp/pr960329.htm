<H2>ANTI-POVERTY INITIATIVE LAUNCHED BY UNDP </H2>

<P><B>Initial $17 Million Provided by UNDP and Two Donor Countries to Help
Governments Formulate Poverty Eradication Strategies </B></P>

<P><I>NEW YORK, <B>29 March 1996</B></I> -- An initiative to help countries
formulate policies and strategies to eradicate absolute poverty was launched
today by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Denmark and the
Netherlands have joined UNDP in contributing an initial US$17 million to
the &quot;Poverty Strategies Initiative,&quot; as it is called. Additional
contributions are expected in the near future. Announcing the initiative,
UNDP Associate Administrator, Rafeeuddin Ahmed, said that it would aim
to help developing counties formulate plans and strategies to eradicate
poverty in the shortest time possible. &quot;Getting rid of poverty is
not an impossible dream,&quot; said Mr. Ahmed. &quot;Countries committed
themselves to this goal at the Social Summit held in Copenhagen, March
1995. The Initiative will help them carry out poverty eradication programmes
many are already putting into place.&quot; </P>

<P>An estimated 1.3 billion people live in absolute poverty, the poorest
on less than $1 a day, according to the United Nations. Every minute of
every day, 47 people are added to the ranks of those living in poverty,
increasing the number of the world's poor by 25 million a year. The UN
General Assembly has declared 1996 as the International Year for the Eradication
of Poverty, noting that poverty eradication is fundamental to reinforcing
peace and achieving sustainable development. </P>

<P>Administered through UNDP offices in 132 countries, the initiative will
help countries formulate or strengthen national plans and strategies that
address the structural causes of poverty and inequalities among various
population groups. For example, it will finance national public awareness
and advocacy campaigns to mobilize organizations of civil society, the
private sector and other groups to join the government in a coordinated
fight against poverty. It will support poverty measurement and mapping
to determine the extent and distribution of poverty within a country. And
it will help governments set national goals and targets for poverty elimination
and review and realign budgets to provide more resources for this task.
The Poverty Strategies Initiative responds to UNDP's mandate from the Social
Summit, which calls upon it to &quot;organize United Nations system efforts
towards capacity-building at the local, national and regional levels, and
support the coordinated implementation of social programmes through its
network of field offices.&quot; </P>
