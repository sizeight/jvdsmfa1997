<H2>UNDP'S ROLE IN POVERTY ERADICATION: MANDATE, ACTION, ACHIEVEMENTS</H2>

<H4>SOCIAL SUMMIT MANDATE</H4>

<P>At the World Summit for Social Development (WSSD) — commonly called
the Social Summit — in Copenhagen, Denmark, March 1995, Heads of State
and senior leaders from over 180 countries acknowledged the worsening problem
of global poverty and pledged to take action to combat it. The WSSD Declaration
and Programme of Action they endorsed recognizes the</P>

<UL>
<P>"urgent need for national strategies to reduce overall poverty substantially,
including measures to remove the structural barriers that prevent people
from escaping poverty, with specific time-bound commitments to eradicate
absolute poverty by a target date to be specified by each country in its
national context." </P>
</UL>

<P>In particular, governments committed themselves to the goal of eradicating
poverty "<I>as an ethical, social, political and economic imperative of
humankind</I>" by ensuring that "<I>people living in poverty have access
to productive resources, including credit, land, education and training,
technology, knowledge and information, and to public services.</I>" They
pledged to </P>

<UL>
<P>"Formulating or strengthening, preferably by the year 1996, and implementing
national poverty eradication plans to address the structural causes of
poverty, encompassing action on the local, national, sub-regional and international
levels. These plans should establish, within each national context, strategies
and affordable time-bound goals and targets for the substantial reduction
of overall poverty and the eradication of absolute poverty. In the context
of national plans, particular attention should be given to employment creation
as a means of eradicating poverty, giving appropriate consideration to
health and education, assigning a higher priority to basic social services,
generating household income, and promoting access to productive assets
and economic opportunities."</P>
</UL>

<P>While recognizing that governments, in partnership with civil society,
have the primary responsibility for eradicating poverty in their respective
countries, the WSSD documents acknowledge the critical role of the UN system
in assisting developing countries in this respect. It is stated that cooperation
among UN specialized agencies, programmes and associated funds should be
improved at the country level through the "<I>resident coordinator system.</I>"
The resident representatives who head the 132 offices UNDP has in developing
countries normally also serve as UN resident coordinators of all UN operational
assistance for development. The Social Summit therefore gave UNDP a special
mandate to:</P>

<UL>
<P>"organize United Nations system efforts towards capacity-building at
the local, national and regional levels, and support the coordinated implementation
of social programmes through its network of field offices."</P>
</UL>

<H4>POVERTY AND UNDP'S FOCUS AREAS</H4>

<P>Reflecting the decisions of the Social Summit, in June 1995 UNDP's Executive
Board decided to make poverty eradication UNDP's overriding priority. As
a result, all UNDP activities are now geared towards, and measured against,
the ultimate goal of poverty eradication. This is considered "job one"
in UNDP's overall effort to build countries' capacities for <B>sustainable
human development</B>, or development that is both people-centered and
preserves the planet for future generations. Activities in UNDP's other
main areas of focus — promotion of jobs and sustainable livelihoods, advancement
of women, environmental preservation and regeneration, and governance —
are therefore closely interrelated with poverty eradication.</P>

<H4>Jobs and Sustainable Livelihoods</H4>

<P>Lack of sufficient income to provide oneself and one's family with adequate
food, shelter, clothing and the other basics of a decent life is probably
the most obvious symptom of poverty. While UNDP sees poverty as a complex
and multi-dimensional problem requiring action on many fronts, there is
no denying that most people living in poverty would put the need for regular
income high on their list of priorities.</P>

<P>Of the world's total labour force of 2.8 billion, around 30 per cent
is not productively employed, according to the International Labour Organisation.
This includes more than 120 million people who are unemployed, and 700
million who are underemployed. These people constitute the bulk of the
world's absolute poor. </P>

<P>In helping countries develop their poverty eradication strategies, UNDP
emphasizes entrepreneurship among people living in poverty. The growth
of jobs in the formal sector is encouraged, but so is the expansion of
non-formal means of livelihood such as self-employment in smallholder agriculture
and micro-enterprises.</P>

<P>In rural areas, creating employment as one means of reducing poverty
means paying attention to agricultural diversification, access to productive
land, pricing policies and expansion of markets for produce. It also requires
the improvement of basic infrastructure, the transfer and adaptation of
appropriate, environmentally sound technologies, and ensuring that credit,
extension services and other inputs are within reach. </P>

<P>In urban areas, support for self-employment and micro-enterprise development
requires the availability of credit, skills training and appropriate, affordable
technology as well. It may also require overcoming regulatory and administrative
obstacles to informal sector activities and reducing barriers to market
entry.</P>

<H4>Advancement of Women</H4>

<P>The UN's Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing, China, September,
1995, called the world's attention to the fact that a disproportionate
percentage of its women live in poverty. Long denied access to equal opportunities
for education, training and land ownership, and burdened by heavy workloads
including family care, water portage and the collection of household fuel,
women are also largely cut off from decision-making and land ownership.
Often, they are left to cope as heads of household when their husbands
leave home to seek employment. The statistics speak for themselves: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Female wages average only two-thirds those of men. </LI>

<LI>Distribution of income, land, credit and social services remains heavily
skewed towards males. </LI>

<LI>Two out of every three illiterates are women. </LI>

<LI>Women account for 70 per cent of the world's one billion people living
in abject poverty. </LI>
</UL>

<P>UNDP's gender in development policy looks at women not as a separate
group needing special attention, but as members of societies, with men.
It helps governments focus on the social, economic, political and cultural
forces that conspire to keep women poor — forces which determine the activities
in which women and men engage, the responsibilities entrusted to them,
how they interact with one another, the attitudes with which members of
each sex are viewed, and the extent to which women and men control resources
and participate in decision-making. </P>

<P>To help women lift themselves out of poverty, UNDP supports the development
of national policies that seek to expand women's opportunities for education,
training and better health care. It strives to provide them with access
to cash income, markets and resources, especially land, credit and information.
It advocates the removal of all legal and cultural barriers to the full
participation of women in society, giving them the right to own land and
productive resources, to borrow money and to inherit property on an equitable
and non-discriminatory basis. </P>

<P>The approach is based on sound evidence that overall community well-being
improves when women's opportunities increase. For example, female education
and training are known to help reduce fertility rates, improve family health
and nutrition and raise household earnings; women's participation in national
policy-making results in greater emphasis on the social sector. </P>

<H4>Environmental Preservation and Regeneration</H4>

<P>The deterioration of a country's natural resource base through over
consumption and mismanagement is a prime cause of poverty — and vice versa.
For example, the depletion of soil and water resources can decimate farmer's
incomes, lower the nutritional status of the population, and put a large
hole in a country's foreign exchange reserves if sizeable food imports
are required. At the same time, those living in extreme poverty in depleted
rural areas are victims of a no-win situation. Their very survival forces
them to overgraze their livestock and chop down any remaining trees for
fuelwood, even at the expense of further environmental degradation.</P>

<P>Because of the inextricable links between poverty and the environment,
UNDP helps governments develop policies in these areas that are intertwined.
It encourages environmentally sound farming, fishing and forestry techniques
that promote food security and sustain livelihoods while ensuring the long-term
viability of resources. It advocates improving small farmers' access to
land, protecting the traditional knowledge and practices of nomadic and
indigenous people and promoting the traditional rights of agro-pastoralists
to common property resources, all of which can contribute significantly
to more sustainable methods of cultivation and grazing.</P>

<P>In developing country cities, the urban population has tripled over
the last 30 years and it is projected that half of all city dwellers will
live in poverty by the end of this century. Here, UNDP's priority is to
unite governments and urban residents in efforts to provide clean water
and sanitation, to ensure waste treatment and the control of chemical pollutants,
and to rehabilitate neighborhoods and prevent a deterioration of the living
conditions of the poor.</P>

<P>In disaster-prone areas, people living in poverty are always the hardest
hit by droughts, floods and earthquakes. UNDP's focus is on disaster prevention
and management systems that can make these areas more resilient. </P>

<P>UNDP supports several networks that strengthen local institutions, share
relevant and replicable experiences and demonstrate local solutions in
the areas of environment and poverty reduction. Farmers, non-governmental
organizations, community based organizations and other stakeholders are
among the participants, many of whom are reached via computer.</P>

<H4>Governance</H4>

<P>Poverty is often synonymous with inequality. It is a result of deeply
embedded differences in the distribution of power and resources in society
that prevent certain groups from participating fully in the economic, political,
social, cultural and spiritual life of their community. </P>

<P>An important step toward poverty eradication is the establishment of
an enabling policy environment in which resources and opportunities are
equitably distributed and all people have a chance to participate in shaping
the decisions that affect their lives. As a long-trusted, non-political
development partner with vast worldwide experience, UNDP is ideally placed
to help countries with this sensitive task. By promoting transparent and
accountable systems of governance and public administration it is helping
a number of countries attack the root causes of poverty and inequality,
and remove the structural barriers limiting people's choices. </P>

<P>Features of this support include promotion of an efficient and responsive
public sector; respect for pluralism, gender equity and human rights; a
stable, non-discriminatory and predictable legal framework that gives people
access to an independent, fair and effective judicial system; a budgetary
process that is transparent and accountable; a fair and effective system
of taxation; and decentralization of government to the local level.</P>

<H4>FUNDING FOR POVERTY ERADICATION</H4>

<P>UNDP's support for anti-poverty programmes comes mainly from:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Country and regional allocations from UNDP "core" resources, totalling
about US$1 billion a year, derived from the voluntary contributions of
member governments; </LI>

<LI>"cost-sharing" contributions for particular poverty eradication activities,
provided by programme country and donor country governments. In addition,
in March 1996, UNDP launched a new, relatively small but clearly targeted
"Poverty Strategies Initiative" designed explicitly to support countries'
follow-up to and implementation of their Social Summit commitments on poverty
eradication. An initial US$17 million is provided to help countries formulate
or strengthen national plans and strategies that address the structural
causes of poverty and inequalities among various population groups. UNDP,
Denmark and the Netherlands are the original donors to the initiative.
It will finance such activities as national public awareness and advocacy
campaigns to mobilize organizations of civil society, the private sector
and other groups to join the government in a coordinated fight against
poverty. It will support poverty measurement and mapping to determine the
extent and distribution of poverty within a country. And it will help governments
set national goals and targets for poverty elimination and review and realign
budgets to provide more resources for this task.</LI>
</UL>

<H4>ACTION AND ACHIEVEMENTS</H4>

<P>The following examples show how UNDP is working in its five programme
regions to help governments and people eradicate poverty. While some activities
illustrate the way in which UNDP is carrying out the capacity-building
and coordinating roles assigned at Copenhagen, others, begun before the
Social Summit, show the tangible effects activities are having on people's
lives. </P>

<H4>SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA</H4>

<P><B><I>Botswana.</I></B>In 1991, UNDP and UNICEF helped the government
analyze the state of human development in Botswana and plan development
activities for the next 15 years. It was found that four key issues had
to be addressed: population growth, poverty, environmental degradation
and HIV and AIDS. Since May 1995, UNDP and the government have been collaborating
to draft a poverty eradication strategy. To this end, UNDP and the Botswana
Institute for Development Policy Analysis are jointly assessing the extent
of poverty in the country and reevaluating instruments for addressing contributing
factors. This review will involve both central and local government authorities
and groups at all levels of Botswana's civil society, including academia
and NGOs. Findings will be critical in finalizing Botswana's poverty eradication
strategy.</P>

<P><B><I>Zimbabwe.</I></B> In February 1995, the Government of Zimbabwe
launched a national poverty alleviation action plan (PAAP). With technical
assistance from UNDP, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), community-based
organizations (CBOs), the private sector and other parts of civil society
were involved in conceiving the PAAP, which was aimed at improving the
living conditions of the poorest segments of the population. In support
of the PAAP, UNDP and other donors financed a nation-wide poverty assessment
study that produced a comprehensive picture of poverty in Zimbabwe through
a questionnaire presented to 16,000 households and the homeless. In addition,
UNDP and the government have hosted six workshops to discuss poverty eradication
in the context of sustainable human development. UNDP is sponsoring poverty
dialogue between the government and civil society through the Poverty Forum,
a national think tank. The outcome of this dialogue will be reflected in
the National Human Development Report, which the Forum will prepare with
the University of Zimbabwe. UNDP also plans to translate the PAAP into
local languages to involve communities in poverty eradication. UNDP and
the government have begun talks on how to integrate the PAAP with Zimbabwe's
national development plans and the second phase of its Economic Reform
Programme. The World Bank is co-financing some of the activities.</P>

<P><B><I>Benin.</I></B> In Benin's Agu&eacute;gu&eacute;s district, revenues
from fishing, the main source of income, are declining due to intensive
exploitation of fish resources and an increase in the number of fishermen.
At the same time, conditions in the community need improvement: schools
and health clinics are lacking or in bad repair; life expectancy is less
than 50 years, due mainly to high infant mortality; during the rainy season,
roads become impassable, isolating Agu&eacute;gu&eacute;s. Support from
UNDP and the UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) is helping the population
improve their living conditions, protect the environment and make better
use of natural resources. Seven schools and three health centres have been
built, along with houses for teachers and health workers and a government
building. A village credit fund has helped 972 people establish new enterprises.
Fishermen have adopted improved techniques, and consciousness of the need
for environmental protection is spreading. New cooperative village structures
have been set up, notably by women and youth. UNCDF is helping to finance
additional social infrastructure, feeder roads and dams. </P>

<P><B><I>Ethiopia.</I></B> Ethiopia emerged from nearly 30 years of civil
strife with thousands of communities in need of rehabilitation, thousands
of returning refugees and some 400,000 demobilized soldiers. The Ethiopian
Social Rehabilitation and Development Fund began to test a self-help, community-based
approach to rehabilitation and development in 1992. In the initial phase,
1,220,000 people benefitted from more than 200 projects: clinics, schools,
drainage facilities, communal latrines, small dams and income generating
enterprises like grinding mills, quarries and electrical workshops. Community
organizations, local government staffs and NGOs simultaneously improved
project planning and implementation capacities. The Fund is being expanded
to implement small-scale, community-based projects throughout rural Ethiopia.
UNDP is helping to mobilize the US$243 million required for this phase,
and to put together machinery to effectively manage these resources. Joining
UNDP and the government in this effort are the World Bank, Canada, Italy,
Norway and Sweden.</P>

<H4>ASIA AND THE PACIFIC</H4>

<P><B><I>Thailand.</I></B> Despite the absence of a separate poverty eradication
strategy, Thailand has always had targets for the reduction of poverty
and inequity within the context of its economic and social development
plans. Since its 1982-86 development plan, Thailand has emphasized rural
development, with poverty reduction as the main goal. To track progress,
the government introduced Basic Minimum Needs (BMN) standards, consisting
of 37 indicators, to measure the level of development in 60,000 villages
annually. While progress has been impressive on many fronts, there is a
need to intensify efforts to improve household incomes, access to clean
drinking water and vocational training. Current critical objectives are
to reduce poverty by 20 per cent by the end of 1996; to improve the BMN
standards of rural households; to increase income and employment opportunities
for landless farmers and low-income households; and to engage local organizations
in environmental conservation. In preparing its 1997-2001 development plan,
Thailand is expected to update the BMN standards and implement additional
measures to address equity issues, nationally and regionally. </P>

<P><B><I>Viet Nam.</I></B> At the Social Summit, the Government of Viet
Nam made public its pledge to eradicate all poverty, as measured by current
standards, by the year 2010. UNDP played a crucial role in assisting the
government in preparing its presentation. Subsequently, UNDP, UNICEF and
UNFPA jointly carried out an in-depth analysis of the structural causes
of poverty in Viet Nam that provides a broad framework for government,
donor and local community poverty eradication efforts. UNDP will conduct
a second Living Standards Survey in 1996-97, the results of which will
contribute to the development of effective strategies for the National
Programme for Hunger Eradication and Poverty Eradication that the government
is now preparing. UNDP has also finalized a preparatory assistance document
for the launch of this programme. </P>

<P><B><I>Indonesia.</I></B> Indonesia has reduced the number of its citizens
living in absolute poverty to around 14 per cent of the total population
— some 26 million people. To identify and reach this group, the government
has undertaken a new poverty alleviation programme involving dialogue with
— and direct grants for — the poorest people in 20,633 "Left Behind" villages.
Guidelines were prepared on the basis of a UNDP-funded review of the government's
poverty alleviation programmes over the last 25 years. Assistance was also
provided to strengthen national poverty alleviation targeting and analytical
capabilities, including the development of a more accurate data base. In
addition, UNDP was asked to fund a socio-economic baseline study in 297
least-developed villages in the remote provinces of Irian Jaya, Maluku
and central Sulawesi. </P>

<P><B><I>China.</I></B> China's "8-7" programme aims to raise the living
standards of the 80 million Chinese citizens who still live below the poverty
line, in seven years. This programme includes a poverty alleviation initiative
targeting six poor counties in Southwestern China, supported by UNDP and
several UN agencies. It emphasizes income generation, health and education,
and features a participatory approach. UNDP is supporting the work of the
China Community Corps in identifying poor households and organizing members
into self-help groups. The World Food Programme (WFP) is contributing food
aid to support terracing and other sustainable agricultural practices.
UNICEF provides maternal/child health care and primary education. The International
Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) provides for rural credit. </P>

<H4>LATIN AMERICAN AND THE CARIBBEAN</H4>

<P><B><I>Jamaica.</I></B> At the request of the government, UNDP brought
together representatives from the government, the donor and lender communities,
NGOs and CBOs to devise a strategy to eradicate poverty in Jamaica. Representatives
of poor communities also participated in the design of this programme,
that seeks to create jobs and sustainable livelihoods, recycle capital
and empower communities to seize opportunities for economic development.
UNDP also drew up a special programme to support Jamaica's poverty eradication
policy. During 1996, UNDP will be assisting communities in rural areas
to identify programmes and projects to reduce poverty, individually and
collectively. The emphasis will be on income generation and employment.
UNDP is also working with the government to tap the expertise of NGOs in
implementing the poverty eradication policy.</P>

<P><B><I>Nicaragua.</I></B> The Government of Nicaragua has long acknowledged
the incidence of poverty in the country. A 1993 survey revealed that 74.8
per cent of the population lives in poverty. Nicaragua's civil society,
the Catholic Church and the international community have all expressed
concern and sought government attention to tackle this problem. The government's
commitment to action is contained in Nicaragua's national development programme
(1996-2000). Since 1993, UNDP has been helping the government introduce
social policies to balance its structural adjustment plan. This resulted
in the launching of a human development strategy known as Reactivacion
Solidaria and the creation of a new Ministry of Social Action. The government's
commitment to eradicating poverty was further reaffirmed after the Social
Summit when an interministerial committee was established to follow up
on the agreements made at Copenhagen. For several years now, UNDP has been
supporting a host of projects in Nicaragua that are specifically targeted
to reduce poverty. PRODERE, carried out in six Central American countries,
began as an initiative for the consolidation of peace and the reintegration
of thousands of people who suffered during the civil war. It slowly evolved
into a programme centred on combating poverty and providing citizens a
dignified means of livelihood. This model is being replicated in other
war-torn countries such as Cambodia.</P>

<P><B><I>El Salvador.</I></B> Some 7,000 farmers in the Caba&ntilde;as
and San Vicente departments of El Salvador have benefitted from UNDP support
to the Project Execution Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture. Of these,
more than 2,000 small agricultural producers have received credits totalling
US$1.1 million. Approximately 2,500 Project Execution Unit technicians
and small producers have been trained in sustainable agricultural techniques,
entrepreneurial development and credit management. Twenty-six demonstration
farms have been established to carry out research and extension activities.
Six pilot commercial groups have been established, resulting in the farmers
paying lower prices for seeds and fertilizer, and receiving high prices
for their produce. Many farmers have diversified their production from
basic crops and are now producing vegetables and fruit.</P>

<H4>ARAB STATES</H4>

<P><B><I>Egypt.</I></B> Egypt's leaders acknowledge that poverty is the
country's greatest challenge as it seeks to secure a place in the newly-emerging
world economic order. Two National Human Development Reports, prepared
with UNDP support, have highlighted the disparities in the levels of development
among the country's 26 governorates. Population growth and unequal economic
status are considered the main reasons for poverty. UNDP supported the
establishment of Egypt's Social Fund for Development, which is helping
to reduce the number of vulnerable people through job creation. The Mubarak
Takaful project of the Ministry of Social Affairs continues to support
the poorest of the poor. To synchronize government initiatives, UNDP is
helping Egypt to create a national poverty map, highlighting the pockets
of poverty, quantifying the size of the problem, prioritizing follow-up
actions and devising an early warning system for preventive action. This
map will form the basis for a national poverty eradication strategy that
will address the immediate, medium-term and long-term needs of the poor.</P>

<P><B><I>Morocco.</I></B> In 1993, UNDP helped the Government of Morocco
examine the structural causes of poverty and review safety nets for the
vulnerable segments of its population. UNDP also supported a household
standards of living survey which yielded a profile of poverty in the country.
Despite these investigations, reference to "poverty" was not readily accepted
by the authorities. Morocco's participation in the Social Summit changed
this: now, the Moroccan Government has declared poverty eradication as
its priority goal for the period 1996-2000 and has requested support in
attaining it from the UN system. As a first step, UNDP will assist in the
formulation of a national plan of action for the eradication of poverty.
Jointly with an NGO, UNDP will launch a pilot project that will introduce
an integrated and participatory approach to poverty alleviation that could
be replicated in other parts of the country. UNDP has also initiated contact
with the Union Nationale des Femmes du Maroc to start up two projects targeting
women in poor regions in the north and south of Morocco. Early next year,
UNDP will launch three pilot poverty eradication schemes in rural and urban
areas that are tailor-made for Morocco's needs.</P>

<P><B><I>Sudan.</I></B> Area Development Schemes in five drought-prone
rural areas of Sudan take a participatory approach to eradicating poverty
in an environmentally sustainable way. Developed in collaboration with
several UN agencies, the schemes have benefitted half a million people
in 2000 of the country's poorest villages. Participants have been mobilized,
organized and trained to select, implement and manage activities through
Village Development Committees, over 30 per cent of whose members are women.
Credit comes from revolving funds jointly financed by the communities and
UNDP. Fields covered include agriculture, afforestation, water supply,
handicrafts, small-scale industry, and other income generating pursuits.
The UNDP coordinates technical assistance from a number of UN agencies:
United Nations Office for Project Services (UN/OPS), Food and Agriculture
Organization of the UN (FAO), International Labour Organisation (ILO),
United Nations Department for Development Support and Management Services
(UN/DDSMS). Related social services are provided by UNICEF (in one province);
food-for-work by the World Food Programme. The approach will be replicated
in other countries. </P>

<H4>EUROPE AND THE CIS</H4>

<P><B><I>Bulgaria.</I></B> Poverty is considered a relatively new phenomenon
in Bulgaria. The fall of the former government in 1989 caused the collapse
of the Bulgarian economy, disrupting traditional productive and trading
systems and creating pockets of poverty across the land. Since then, UNDP
has been involved in many initiatives to address poverty in Bulgaria. Studies
have been conducted to analyze poverty, identify its underlying causes
and forecast the impact of further structural adjustments. In 1995, as
part of Bulgaria's preparations for the Social Summit, UNDP assisted the
government in a study on poverty levels in the country and the role of
NGOs and CBOs in enhancing social integration. As a follow-up to the Social
Summit, UNDP assisted the government in developing a national strategy
to combat poverty and unemployment. Plans are underway to strengthen NGOs
to enable them to address poverty issues. During 1996, UNDP will review
its projects in Bulgaria and discontinue those that do not contribute to
fighting poverty and protecting the environment. It will also work with
the national and local civil service to identify vulnerable groups and
devise action plans to reduce unemployment.</P>

<P><B><I>Latvia.</I></B> Although Latvia's new government was only formed
in October 1995 it is very committed to developing a national strategy
on poverty eradication in line with the Social Summit Programme of Action.
In its transition to a market-oriented economy, Latvia is coping with the
prevalence of relative and absolute poverty amongst its population. UNDP
has already discussed with the government a three-stage process to develop
a national poverty eradication strategy. As a first step, UNDP raised public
awareness by generating debate and discussion on poverty among civil society,
prior to helping produce Latvia's 1995 National Human Development Report.
The 1996 Report will discuss the linkages between poverty, inequality and
economic reforms as a precursor to the development of a comprehensive national
poverty eradication strategy. </P>
