<H2>POVERTY WITNESSES SPEAK OUT AND &quot;POVERTY CLOCK&quot; IS ACTIVATED
BY HEAD OF UNDP TO MARK ANTI-POVERTY YEAR</H2>

<P><I>NEW YORK, <B>17 JANUARY 1996</B></I> -- &quot;We must never forget
that behind every tick of the clock there is a face, a person, a life,&quot;
said James Gustave Speth, Administrator of the United Nations Development
Programme, as he started a &quot;poverty clock&quot; ticking in the lobby
of the United Nations building here today. The event recognized 1996 as
the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty. The clock ticks
every time another person joins the ranks of the poor, some 47 a minute
or more than 67,000 every day. </P>

<P>Three of the people whose lives have been touched by poverty but who
are working their way out of poverty travelled to the UN from Zimbabwe,
Bolivia and Harlem (New York) to tell their tales of fighting against poverty
in their communities:</P>

<P>&middot; Betty Bangira, a Zimbabwean mother of four, found her life
changed when her community joined with five others to create an irrigation
project in one of the country's desertified provinces; </P>

<P>&middot; Luis Ticona Mamani, an indigenous Aymara of the Bolivian highlands,
is now the director of an association of alpaca herdsmen which has tripled
incomes of families in the region; </P>

<P>&middot; Lenore Cola, a mother of three and a Harlem resident whose
family was homeless for four years, became involved in 1989 in a street
library programme for children and their parents. </P>

<P>&quot;This event is a cause for both alarm and optimism,&quot; said
UNDP Administrator Speth. &quot;Alarm because we are turning on a poverty
clock which will remind us that each day another 67,000 people join the
ranks of the poor. That's about 25 million people a year, most of whom
will be in the developing world. Optimism because the international community
now recognizes the urgency of this problem, realizes what must be done
and is taking steps to halt, indeed reverse, this grim trend.&quot; </P>

<P>UNDP has made poverty eradication the overarching goal of its programmes,
working through 135 offices in developing countries, and building its expertise
in the area. The agency is supporting developing countries as they build
or strengthen national poverty eradication strategies, setting timed targets
for progress.</P>

<P>The ceremony was enlivened by the pan flute of Jorge Cabrera, an Ecuadoran
musician who participates in the Metropolitan Transit Authority's Music
Underground programme.</P>

<P>Cooperating with UNDP in sponsoring the event was International Movement
ATD Fourth World, a non-governmental organization dedicated to helping
individuals and families free themselves from extreme poverty, and which
successfully pressed to have October 17 declared the International Day
for Poverty Eradication. The street library programme of Ms. Cola is organized
by ATD Fourth World.</P>
