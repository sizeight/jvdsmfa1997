<H2><B>POVERTY CLOCK</B> </H2>

<P>The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) created its Poverty
Clock to illustrate how quickly poverty grows. The digital clock ticks
off the increase in the number of people who are living on less than a
dollar day around the world. The Poverty Clock was first activated last
year during the World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen, Denmark,
and was later sent to the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing,
China. During the 1996 International Year for the Eradication of Poverty,
the clock stands as a stark reminder that deprivation and suffering continue.
Poverty eradication, however, is an achievable goal. &quot;The commitment
to end poverty endures long after the clock is turned off,&quot; says UNDP
Administrator James Gustave Speth. &quot;One hundred and fifty years ago
the world launched a crusade against slavery. Today we must launch a world
crusade against mass poverty.&quot; <BR>
</P>

<H4>The calculation of the Poverty Clock </H4>

<P>The number of people living in absolute poverty is increasing by nearly
25 million a year. This calculation is based on the World Bank and the
United Nations definition of absolute poverty: those people whose incomes
are no more than $370 a year. The number of people currently living in
absolute poverty is roughly 1.3 billion. </P>

<P>Recent data from the World Bank and the Human Development Report suggest
that the aggregate number of poor people worldwide is increasing at roughly
the same rate as the annual population growth of the developing world,
or about 1.88 per cent. </P>

<P>Based on these statistics, the Poverty Clock is ticking off the number
of new people living in poverty at approximately 47 per minute.<BR>
</P>

<H4>Text on the face of the Poverty Clock: </H4>

<P>As delegates to this world event deliberate over the most pressing problems
of our time, hundreds of thousands of people will be born into poverty.
The conclusions reached at the Conference on Population and Development
in Cairo, the Social Summit in Copenhagen and the Fourth World Conference
on Women in Beijing can make a difference in the lives of these people,
but only if we collectively take action to stop the Poverty Clock from
ticking.</P>

<P>Every number on the clock indicates another person living in poverty.
These are people who can expect to earn as little as $370 a year -- about
$1 a day. They will most likely be undernourished, uneducated and undervalued
by the societies in which they live. Eradicating poverty means more than
the expansion of material wealth; it means enhancing people's sense of
their own well-being, generating hope for the future. <BR>

<H4><B>Sources of information:</B> </H4>

<P>The calculation is based on extensive consultations with population
statisticians at the UN Population Trends Unit, and the World Bank Statistics
Office. Other sources were a study, <I>&quot;Rooting Out Poverty,&quot;</I>
by Actionaid, and a paper, &quot;<I>Is Poverty Increasing in the Developing
World?&quot;</I> by Martin Ravallion, Shaohua Chen and Gaurav Datt of the
World Bank.</P>
