<P>The World Alliance of Cities Against Poverty is an initiative of UNDP's
European office in Geneva, in coordination with the UNDP Division of Public
Affairs (DPA), New York. It aims to raise public awareness and mobilize
energies, during the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty
(1996) and beyond, for new initiatives to combat poverty throughout the
decade. </P>

<P>UNDP is enroling as many cities as possible in the Alliance through
its 137 offices worldwide. It aims at ensuring that all countries are represented.
Membership is acquired upon ratification by the city government of the
"Appeal of Cities Against Poverty" (over); and the purchase of "shares"
sold to defray the costs of global anti-poverty communication campaigns
coordinated by the European Office and DPA. Each city is encouraged to
buy from one to ten shares at US$500 for industrialized country, and US$100
dollars for developing country.</P>

<P>Aberdeen, Bern, Bonn, Cochabamba, Del&eacute;mont, Frankfurt, Genoa,
Herning, Kolding, Lillehammer, Lisbon, Li&egrave;ge, Madrid, Prez Zeledon,
Rome, Rosario, Tromsc and Yerevan are among the first cities to have joined
the Alliance. </P>

<P>By raising public awareness about the nature, causes and prevalence
of poverty, as well as its devastating impact on human wellbeing, the Alliance
hopes to activate a wave of new anti-poverty initiatives by all sectors
of society, including individuals, associations, businesses and institutions.
Cities are also encouraged to take action locally and internationally to
give strength and impact to their commitment.</P>

<P>UNDP will give the Alliance broad publicity worldwide and periodically
report to each member city on the campaign's progress. Cities' endorsement
of the appeal, and desire to purchase shares, should be communicated to
UNDP at the following address: </P>
