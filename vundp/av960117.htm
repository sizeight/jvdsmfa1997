<H2>ACHIEVEMENTS IN POVERTY ELIMINATION</H2>

<P>More than one fifth of the world's people live in extreme poverty, on
little more than US$1.00 a day. UNDP sees poverty as a complex and multi-dimensional
phenomenon, involving people's lack of empowerment, as well as their lack
of income and basic services.</P>

<P>UNDP supports programmes that assist governments and organisations of
civil society in developing economic and social policies and programmes
to address the whole range of factors that contribute to poverty. Among
other things, these programmes seek to increase food security; improve
the availability and quality of shelter and basic services; generate opportunities
for employment and sustainable livelihoods; empower women and men through
access to assets and productive resources such as land, credit, technology,
training and markets; and enable people to participate in the political
forces that shape their lives. Here are some examples.<BR>

<P><B>INDONESIA: &quot;LEFT BEHIND&quot; VILLAGES</B></P>

<P><B>Indonesia</B> has reduced the number of its citizens living in absolute
poverty to around 14 per cent of the total population -- some 26 million
people. To identify and reach this group, the Government has undertaken
a new poverty alleviation programme involving dialogue with -- and direct
grants for -- the poorest people in 20,633 &quot;Left Behind&quot; villages.
Guidelines were prepared on the basis of a UNDP-funded review of the Government's
poverty alleviation programmes over the last 25 years. Assistance was also
provided to strengthen national poverty alleviation targeting and analytical
capabilities, including the development of a more accurate data base. In
addition, UNDP was asked to fund a socio-economic baseline study in 297
least-developed villages in the remote provinces of Irian Jaya, Maluku
and central Sulawesi. (UNDP contribution: $709,628; Duration (1994-96);
Partners: Belgium).<BR>

<P><B>CHINA: TARGETING 80 MILLION</B></P>

<P><B>China's</B> &quot;8-7&quot; programme aims to raise the living standards
of the 80 million Chinese citizens who still live below the poverty line,
in seven years. This programme includes a poverty alleviation initiative
targeting six poor counties in South-western China, supported by UNDP and
several UN agencies. It emphasises income generation, health and education,
and features a participatory approach. UNDP is supporting the work of the
China Community Corps in identifying poor households and organising members
into self-help groups. The World Food Programme (WFP) is contributing food
aid to support terracing and other sustainable agricultural practices.
UNICEF provides maternal/child health care and primary education. The International
Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) provides for rural credit. (UNDP
contribution: $3 million; Duration: 1994 - 2001; Partners: World Food Programme
($3 million), UNICEF ($400,000), International Fund for Agricultural Development
($500,000)) </P>

<B>SUDAN - AREA DEVELOPMENT SCHEMES</B></P>

<P>Area Development Schemes in five drought-prone rural areas of <B>Sudan</B>
take a participatory approach to eradicating poverty in an environmentally
sustainable way. Developed in collaboration with several UN agencies, the
schemes have benefited half a million people in 2000 of the country's poorest
villages. Participants have been mobilised, organised and trained to select,
implement and manage activities through Village Development Committees,
over 30 per cent of whose members are women. Credit comes from revolving
funds jointly financed by the communities and UNDP. Fields covered include
agriculture, afforestation, water supply, handicrafts, small-scale industry,
and other income generating pursuits. The approach will be replicated in
other countries. (UNDP contribution: $28.3 million; Duration: 1990-1996;
Partners: Government of Sudan, with technical assistance from United Nations
Office for Project Services (UN/OPS), Food and Agriculture Organisation
of the UN (FAO), International Labour Organisation (ILO) and United Nations
Department for Development Support and Management Services (UN/DDSMS).
Related social services provided by UNICEF (in one province) and food-for-work
by World Food Programme.)<BR>

<P><B>NAMIBIA: &quot;BUILD-TOGETHER&quot; HOUSING</B></P>

<P>Prior to independence in 1990, inferior housing was all that was available
for the majority of <B>Namibia's</B> people. With UNDP support the Government
is implementing a national housing programme that enables the lowest income
groups to build their own houses. Some 3,380 families have been able to
purchase plots, construct new homes or improve old ones through the &quot;Build-Together&quot;
National Housing Programme. With loans averaging US$3,600, this scheme
enables families to build their own houses according to individual needs,
priorities and resources. It is estimated that if the Government had tried
to build the houses, it would have cost three times as much, and the residents
would be much less satisfied. (UNDP contribution: $851,000; Duration: 1992-95;

<P><B>EL SALVADOR: SUPPORTING SMALL FARMERS</B></P>

<P>Some 7,000 farmers in the Caba&ntilde;as and San Vicente departments
of <B>El Salvador</B> have benefited from UNDP support to the Project Execution
Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture. Of these, more than 2,000 small agricultural
producers have received credits totalling US$1.1 million. Approximately
2,500 Project Execution Unit technicians and small producers have been
trained in sustainable agricultural techniques, entrepreneurial development
and credit management. Twenty-six demonstration farms have been established
to carry out research and extension activities. Six pilot commercial groups
have been established, resulting in the farmers paying lower prices for
seeds and fertiliser, and receiving high prices for their produce. Many
farmers have diversified their production from basic crops and are now
producing vegetables and fruit. (UNDP contribution: $197,000; Duration:
1993-99; Partner: Central American Bank for Economic Integration.)</P>
