<P><B>Special Event in Support of the International Year for the Eradication
of Poverty </B></P>

<P><B>Mr. James Gustave Speth</B></P>

<P>I'm pleased that so many of you are able to join us today for this event,
which is both a cause for alarm and optimism.</P>

<P>Alarm because we are turning on a poverty clock which will remind us
that each day another 67,000 people join the ranks of the poor. That's
about 25 million people a year, most of whom will be in the developing
world. Seven out of 10 will be female.</P>

<P>Optimism because the international community now recognizes the urgency
of this problem, realises what must be done and is taking steps to halt,
indeed reverse, this grim trend.</P>

<P>The job ahead of us is monumental. Not only do we have the task of raising
the incomes of the 1.3 billion people living on less than $1 a day, we
also face the daunting task of creating greater equity, opportunity and
empowerment.</P>

<P>Last March in Copenhagen, at the United Nations Social Summit, world
leaders came together to acknowledge the worsening problem of global poverty,
deplore its spread and commit themselves to actions to reverse this trend.
Never before have so many heads of state and government joined hands to
reach a consensus on building a poverty-free world. </P>

<P>The agreements reached at the Social Summit are revolutionary in their
scope, complexity and urgency. And they highlight the key role to be played
by people-centred development in eradicating poverty.</P>

<P>That's where the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) comes in.
We're about development that protects and regenerates the environment,
creates jobs and income-opportunities, gives women a chance to be full
partners in society and, above all, helps reduce the incidence and impact
of poverty.</P>

<P>We are committed to creating a strong enabling environment that supports
economic growth; gives priority to the poor, to jobs and to sustainable
livelihoods; and encourages participation, tolerance and respect for human
diversity.</P>

<P>In the battle against poverty, UNDP has taken many important steps forward
since the Social Summit. I'd like to name a few:</P>

<P>&middot; With the support of the national governments that are members
of UNDP, we've made poverty-eradication our overarching goal.</P>

<P>&middot; We're working with developing countries to build or strengthen
national poverty-eradication strategies with time-bound targets for progress.</P>

<P>&middot; And, at our headquarters here in New York and in all of our
offices worldwide, we've increased the number of staff working on poverty
issues and projects.</P>

<P>We must not accept that the poor will always be with us. The world has
the material and natural resources, the know-how and the people to make
a poverty-free world a reality. And until the Social Summit last March,
all that was lacking was the global commitment.</P>

<P>This is more than just a dream. One hundred sixty years ago the world
launched a crusade against slavery. Most people were sceptical. But there
was a will to change. Today, I call upon you to launch a similar crusade
-- for a world without poverty.</P>

<P>Let me conclude with a comment about the clock. We see unrelenting growth
in the numbers. But we must never forget that behind every tick of the
clock, there is a face, a person, a life. We're talking about people. In
the end, that's what the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty
is all about.</P>

<P>Our goal for today, for the entire Year and beyond, is to maintain the
momentum gained in Copenhagen and to build upon it. We must search for
innovative ways to transform the concepts presented and the resolutions
reached at the Social Summit into a positive reality that lifts people
out of poverty, makes a difference in their lives and -- more than anything
else -- helps stop this clock.<BR>
