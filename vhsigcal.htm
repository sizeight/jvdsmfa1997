<P>As stated in the conclusion of the <A HREF="vhevsigg.htm">abstract
for my SIGGRAPH 97 Art &amp; Design Sketches presentation</A>
entitled, THE VIRTUAL HARVESTER project: "... I am interested in how
projects like these can be used to generate 'media events', giving
rise to popular awareness of the use of the world wide web and it's
capacity as an inexpensive distribution network. This communication
medium has enormous potential to implement and affect development
programs around the world."</P>

<P>I would find it very interesting to hear from people working
within the information technology field of the United States, as well
as people attending the SIGGRAPH 97 conference, how they see their
work contributing to development &amp; education in the "developing
world", especially Africa. Should their work aim to contribute to
development &amp; education in Africa at all? If yes, how do they see
it practically implemented ? Maybe one can set up a discussion
whereby a brainstorming session can be held to address this question.
</P>

<P>The comic strip series <A HREF="vhdevelo.htm">BENZA &amp;
BETTY</A>, drawn by my friend Jacques Coetzer for the Agriculture
Research Council (ARC) in South Africa, can be used as catalyst for
such discussion. The project aims to facilitate practical
agriculture-related information to developing communities in Sub
Saharan Africa.</P>

<P><A HREF="vhdevelo.htm">GREEN DISH</A> is a proposal to set-up a
network of people involved in the implementation of digital media
&amp; information technology in the developing world. Researching its
social, economic &amp; cultural context and executing art &amp;
design projects. GREEN DISH rejects any form of social apartheid -
both inside and outside cyberspace.</P>
