<P>"Data Field" was conceptualized to be experienced in one of the
<A HREF="vhpesimu.htm">harbour simulator facilities</A> of
<I>MarineSafety International</I>. Instead of a ship's bridge, the
platform will become a fictional, harvester-cabin. In front of the
viewers, virtually attached to the pilothouse, will be an enormous
virtual harvesting device. This device will make a loud mechanical
noise (amplified by the harbour simulators 3D sound), vibrating the
pilothouse from side to side whilst reaping the harvest. As the yield
is blown into virtual storage trucks moving slowly alongside the
pilothouse, viewers will become aware of the scent of fresh grain
rising above the noise &amp; mechanical activity. The grain odour
will rise from a thick layer of yellow maize, covering the entire
inside floor of the simulator.</P>

<P>The group standing, protected inside the pilothouse, will be able
to steer the virtual combine through green virtual maize fields,
leaving a trail of scorched earth behind the harvester's reaping
blades. Being able to control the movements of the harvester, the
group can choose between several corn fields ripe for reaping,
surrounding them in virtual space. Protruding from amongst the maize
fields are gigantic communication towers serving as beacons amidst
the vast virtual landscape. While the group 'plays the game,' it is
subtly revealed (via incoming messages on the harvester's two-way
radio system) that the virtual corn fields they are busy reaping are
in fact 3D visual data representation fields. The corn fields they
are surrounded by represent the number of people living in absolute
poverty across the globe...</P>
